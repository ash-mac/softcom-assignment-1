 TEHRAN: Iran's supreme leader's office has posted a photomontage of former US president Donald Trump playing golf under the shadow of a warplane alongside a pledge to avenge a deadly 2020 drone strike he ordered. The post on Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's @khamenei_site Twitter account late Thursday warned there was no escape from payback for the US strike outside Baghdad airport which killed Iran's storied foreign operations chief General Qasem Soleimani and his Iraqi lieutenant. "Revenge is inevitable. Soleimani's killer and the man who gave the orders must face vengeance," it said. "Revenge can take place at any moment." Trump left office on Wednesday and flew straight to his Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida, without attending the inauguration of his successor President Joe Biden. Iranian officials have pledged repeatedly that Soleimani will be avenged. Earlier this month, on the first anniversary of his killing, judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi warned that not even Trump was "immune from justice" and that Soleimani's killers would "not be safe anywhere in the world".

 WASHINGTON: The Senate Finance Committee will vote on Friday on Janet Yellen's nomination for Treasury secretary, an early litmus test of bipartisan support for President Joe Biden's ambitious plans for coronavirus relief, infrastructure investment and tax hikes. Yellen, who would be the first woman to head Treasury after breaking that same barrier as Federal Reserve chair from 2014 to 2018, is highly regarded by both her fellow Democrats and by Republicans. The vote two days after Biden became president is quick by recent standards. Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan and has pledged to invest $2 trillion in infrastructure, green energy projects, education and research to boost American competitiveness. Friday's vote on Yellen's nomination may reveal the level of Republican opposition to the Democratic president's plans, for which he is seeking bipartisan support. Already some Republicans are expressing concerns over its price tag and increased debt in a return to fiscal conservatism after running up deficits with the 2017 tax cuts and nearly $5 trillion in coronavirus spending last year under former Republican President Donald Trump. Republican Senator Pat Toomey, a longtime fiscal hawk, said at Yellen's hearing: "We're looking at another spending blowout." Yellen's Republican predecessor, Steven Mnuchin, was not confirmed until three weeks after Trump's inauguration, and then by a 53-47 nearly party-line vote in a Republican-controlled Senate. The committee vote is scheduled for 10 a.m. (1500 GMT) and Senate aides said it could pave the way for a full Senate confirmation vote later in the day on Friday. Yellen faces both an evenly split committee and an evenly divided full Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote if needed. Concerning comments Yellen's confirmation hearing on Tuesday highlighted some Republican lawmakers' concerns about her role in executing Biden's economic policies, including a bigger federal debt burden and repealing parts of their signature 2017 tax cuts. Yellen told senators they needed to "act big" on the proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package or risk a longer recession and long-term economic scarring, job and revenue losses. Her remarks represent a new attitude toward government debt among some economists and policy-makers: Focus on the interest rate being paid and the returns it will generate, rather than the overall amount borrowed. In recent months, Treasury's interest outlays have fallen from pre-pandemic levels due to lower rates. In written answers to senators' questions, Yellen said she would study raising tax rates for "pass-through" small businesses including sole proprietorships, imposing a new minimum corporate tax and raising capital gains taxes on the wealthy. She also endorsed an effective carbon pricing system and financial regulation to combat systemic risks from climate change. Outside partisan factors could cast a shadow over the confirmation vote, including the pending impeachment trial of Trump and an ethics complaint against Republican Senators Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz over their objections to Biden's Nov. 3 election victory even after pro-Trump rioters stormed the US Capitol on Jan 6. With Yellen still awaiting confirmation, the Biden administration on Wednesday named Andy Baukol, a longtime career international finance official, as acting Treasury secretary. A confirmation hearing for Deputy Treasury Secretary nominee Wally Adeyemo has not yet been scheduled.

 BEIJING: A new form of African swine fever identified in Chinese pig farms is most likely caused by illicit vaccines, industry insiders say, a fresh blow to the world's largest pork producer, still recovering from a devastating epidemic of the virus. Two new strains of African swine fever have infected more than 1,000 sows on several farms owned by New Hope Liuhe , China's fourth-largest producer, as well as pigs being fattened for the firm by contract farmers, said Yan Zhichun, the company's chief science officer. Though the strains, which are missing one or two key genes present in the wild African swine fever virus, don't kill pigs like the disease that ravaged China's farms in 2018 and 2019, they cause a chronic condition that reduces the number of healthy piglets born, Yan told Reuters. At New Hope, and many large producers, infected pigs are culled to prevent the spread, making the disease effectively fatal. Although the known infections are limited now, if the strains spread widely, they could slash pork output in the world's top consumer and producer; two years ago, swine fever wiped out half of China's 400 million-head pig herd. Pork prices are still at record levels and China is under pressure to strengthen food security amid the COVID-19 pandemic. "I don't know where they come from, but we find some mild field infections caused by some sort of gene-deleted viruses," Yan said. Wayne Johnson, a Beijing-based veterinarian, said he diagnosed a chronic, or less-lethal, form of the disease in pigs last year. The virus lacked certain genetic components, known as the MGF360 genes. New Hope has found strains of the virus missing both the MGF360 genes and the CD2v genes, Yan said. Research has shown that deleting some MGF360 genes from African swine fever creates immunity. But the modified virus was not developed into a vaccine because it tended to later mutate back to a harmful state. "You can sequence these things, these double deletions, and if it's exactly the same as described in the lab, it's too much of a coincidence, because you would never get that exact deletion," said Lucilla Steinaa, principal scientist at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in Nairobi. There is no approved vaccine for African swine fever, which is not harmful to humans. But many Chinese farmers struggling to protect their pigs have resorted to unapproved products, industry insiders and experts said. They fear illicit vaccines have created accidental infections, which are now spreading. The new strains could proliferate globally through contaminated meat, infecting pigs that are fed on kitchen waste. The virus is known to survive for months in some pork products. China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not respond to two requests for comment. But it has issued at least three warnings against use of unauthorised African swine fever vaccines, cautioning that they could have severe side effects and that producers and users could be charged with a criminal offence. In August, the ministry said it would test pigs for different strains of the virus as part of a nationwide investigation into illegal vaccine use. Any strains with gene deletions could indicate a vaccine had been used, it said. No findings have been published so far on the issue, which is highly sensitive for Beijing. Reporting of the recent African swine fever outbreaks was extensively covered up. MAN-MADE STRAINS After decades of research toward producing a vaccine against the huge, complex swine fever virus, researchers around the world are focussing on live-virus vaccines - the only type to have shown any promise. But such vaccines carry higher risks because even after the virus is weakened so it does not cause serious illness, it can sometimes recover its virulence. One such vaccine used in Spain in the 1960s caused a chronic disease with swollen joints, skin lesions and respiratory issues in pigs that complicated efforts to eradicate African swine fever over the next three decades. Since then, no nation has approved a vaccine for the disease. A vaccine with both MGF360 and CD2v genes deleted is undergoing trials by China's Harbin Veterinary Research Institute after showing promise. Yan said he believes that people have replicated the sequences of virus strains being studied, which have been published in scientific literature, and that pigs injected with illicit vaccines based on them could be infecting others. "It's definitely man-made; this is not a natural strain," he said. Neither Johnson nor Yan have fully sequenced the new swine fever strains. Beijing strictly controls who is allowed to work with the virus, which can only be handled in laboratories with high biosecurity designations. But several private companies have developed test kits that can check for specific genes. GM Biotech, based in China's central Hunan province, said in an online post last week it had developed a test that identifies whether the pathogen is a virulent strain, a single-gene deleted attenuated strain, or a double-gene deleted attenuated strain. The test helps pig producers because the new strains are "very difficult to detect at the initial stage of infection and have a longer incubation period after infection," the company said. The government has not said how widely used illicit vaccines are or who has produced them. But a "vast amount" of pigs in China have nonetheless been vaccinated, Johnson said, a sentiment echoed by many other experts. In 2004-5, when the H5 bird flu strains were spreading across Asia, Chinese laboratories produced several unauthorised live bird flu vaccines, said Mo Salman, a professor of veterinary medicine at Colorado State University, who has worked on animal health in Asia, raising fears that they could produce dangerous new variants. "The current ASF unlawful vaccine(s) in China is repeating history," Salman said.

 LONDON: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday the new English variant of Covid-19 may be associated with a higher level of mortality although he said evidence showed that both vaccines being used in the country are effective against it. "We've been informed today that in addition to spreading more quickly, it also now appears that there is some evidence that the new variant - the variant that was first discovered in London and the southeast (of England) - may be associated with a higher degree of mortality," he told a news briefing. The warning about the higher risk of death from the new variant, which was identified in England late last year, came as a fresh blow after the country had earlier been buoyed by news the number of new Covid-19 infections was estimated to be shrinking by as much as 4% a day. Johnson said however that all the current evidence showed both vaccines remained effective against old and new variants. Data published earlier on Friday showed that 5.38 million people had been given their first dose of a vaccine, with 409,855 receiving it in the past 24 hours, a record high so far. England and Scotland announced new restrictions on Jan. 4 to stem a surge in the disease fuelled by the highly transmissible new variant of the coronavirus, which has led to record numbers of daily deaths and infections this month. The latest estimates from the health ministry suggest that the number of new infections was shrinking by between 1% and 4% a day. Last week, it was thought cases were growing by much as 5%, and the turnaround gave hope that the spread of the virus was being curbed, although the ministry urged caution. The closely watched reproduction "R" number was estimated to be between 0.8 and 1, down from a range of 1.2 to 1.3 last week, meaning that on average, every 10 people infected will infect between eight and 10 other people. But the Office for National Statistics estimated that the prevalence overall remained high, with about one in 55 people having the virus. "Cases remain dangerously high and we must remain vigilant to keep this virus under control," the health ministry said. "It is essential that everyone continues to stay at home, whether they have had the vaccine or not." Britain has recorded more than 3.5 million infections and nearly 96,000 deaths - the world's fifth-highest toll - while the economy has been hammered. Figures on Friday showed public debt at its highest level as a proportion of GDP since 1962, and retailers had their worst year on record.

 WASHINGTON: Lloyd J Austin, a West Point graduate who rose to the Army's elite ranks and marched through racial barriers in a 41-year career, won Senate confirmation Friday to become the nation's first Black secretary of defence. The 93-2 vote gave President Joe Biden his second Cabinet member; Avril Haines was confirmed on Wednesday as the first woman to serve as director of national intelligence. Biden is expected to win approval for others on his national security team in coming days, including Antony Blinken as secretary of state. Biden is looking for Austin to restore stability atop the Pentagon, which went through two Senate-confirmed secretaries of defence and four who held the post on an interim basis during the Trump administration. Austin's confirmation was complicated by his status as a recently retired general. He required a waiver of a legal prohibition on a military officer serving as secretary of defence within seven years of retirement. Austin retired in 2016 after serving as the first Black general to head US Central Command. He was the first Black vice chief of staff of the Army in 2012 and also served as director of the Joint Staff, a behind-the-scenes job that gave him an intimate view of the Pentagon's inner workings. The House and the Senate approved the waiver Thursday, clearing the way for the Senate confirmation vote. Austin, a large man with a booming voice and a tendency to shy from publicity, describes himself as the son of a postal worker and a homemaker from Thomasville, Georgia. He has promised to speak his mind to Congress and to Biden. At his confirmation hearing Tuesday, Austin said he had not sought the nomination but was ready to lead the Pentagon without clinging to his military status and with full awareness that being a political appointee and Cabinet member requires "a different perspective and unique duties from a career in uniform." As vice president, Biden worked closely with Austin in 2010-11 to wind down US military involvement in Iraq while Austin was the top US commander in Baghdad. American forces withdrew entirely, only to return in 2014 after the Islamic State extremist group captured large swaths of Iraqi territory. At Central Command, Austin was a key architect of the strategy to defeat IS in Iraq and Syria. Biden said in December when he announced Austin as his nominee that he considered him "the person we need at this moment," and that he trusts Austin to ensure civilian control of the military. Critics of the nomination have questioned the wisdom of making an exception to the law against a recently retired military officer serving as defense secretary, noting that the prohibition was put in place to guard against undue military influence in national security matters. Only twice before has Congress waived the prohibition in 1950 for George C Marshall during the Korean War and in 2017 for Jim Mattis, the retired Marine general who served as President Donald Trump's first Pentagon chief. Austin has promised to surround himself with qualified civilians. And he made clear at his confirmation hearing that he embraces Biden's early focus on combatting the coronavirus pandemic. "I will quickly review the department's contributions to coronavirus relief efforts, ensuring we are doing everything we can and then some to help distribute vaccines across the country and to vaccinate our troops and preserve readiness," he told the Senate Armed Services Committee. Under questioning by senators, Austin pledged to address white supremacy and violent extremism in the ranks of the military problems that received relatively little public attention from his immediate predecessor, Mark Esper. Austin promised to "rid our ranks of racists," and said he takes the problem personally. "The Defence Department's job is to keep America safe from our enemies," he said. "But we can't do that if some of those enemies lie within our own ranks." Austin said he will insist that the leaders of every military service know that extremist behavior in their ranks is unacceptable. "This is not something we can be passive on," he said. "This is something I think we have to be active on, and we have to lean into it and make sure that we're doing the right things to create the right climate." He offered glimpses of other policy priorities, indicating that he embraces the view among many in Congress that China is the "pacing challenge," or the leading national security problem for the US The Middle East was the main focus for Austin during much of his Army career, particularly when he reached senior officer ranks.

 MUMBAI: Nearly a fortnight after Elon Muskâs Tesla entered India on January 8, his SpaceX on Sunday night broke a world space record by launching 143 satellites in quick succession, beating Indiaâs record of deploying 104 satellites in February 2017. The launch vehicle for the SpaceX record-breaking flight was the Falcon 9 and the mission was designated as Transporter-1. The lift-off at Cape Canaveral in Florida was at 8.31pm IST. At one point, the rocket flew over India and its signal was picked up by Isroâs Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network at Bengaluru. The launch marks the first dedicated mission for SpaceXâs SmallSat Rideshare Program, which enables small-satellite customers to book a ride to orbit with SpaceX directly. The 143 satellites launched on Sunday included commercial and government CubeSats, microsats, what are known as orbiter transfer vehicles and 10 Starlink satellites â the maximum number of spacecraft ever to be deployed in a single mission. This batch of Starlink satellites was the first in the constellation to be placed in the polar orbit. The nearly 90-minute deployment sequence of the satellites having different roles was nail-biting because they separated in a span of a few seconds and a minute. Onboard was also a spacecraft belonging to Nasa. With these satellites, SpaceX aims to provide near-global broadband internet coverage all over the world by 2021. About 10 minutes after lift-off, SpaceX recovered the first stage once again on the âOf Course I Still Love Youâ drone ship stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. Then, about an hour after liftoff, the payloads started deploying over the course of about 90 minutes. According to sources, SpaceX offered a very low price of $15,000 per kilogram for each satellite to be delivered to a polar sun-synchronous orbit.

 JERUSALEM: Israel on Sunday said it has opened its embassy in the United Arab Emirates, following through on last year's US-brokered agreement to establish full diplomatic ties with the Gulf country. Israel's Foreign Ministry said the embassy would be in a temporary office while a permanent location is prepared. Eitan Na'eh, a veteran Israeli diplomat, will serve as the head of mission. Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said the opening of the new embassy would allow the broadening of what already are warm ties between Israel and the UAE. Since formally establishing ties in September, the two countries have already established direct flights and exchanged numerous trade delegations, while thousands of Israeli tourists have visited the UAE. The UAE was the first of four Arab countries to establish or renew ties with Israel under a series of agreements brokered by the Trump administration. The Foreign Ministry said Israel would soon open an interest section in Morocco and a consulate in Dubai. It also said an embassy in Bahrain has been operating for several weeks.

 ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said on Sunday that his country was ready to work with the new US administration and asserted that the world has changed a lot in the last four years and any engagement and relations should be developed on the basis of new ground realities. Under the Trump administration, the relations between Pakistan and the US were chaotic as well as complex. "In (these) four years the world has changed, the region has changed and Pakistan has changed and you have to engage with this new Pakistan," Qureshi said while addressing a press conference in Multan. He said that the Pakistan government was ready to work with the new US government and hoped that the Biden administration would be guided by a "new approach and new policy guidelines." "I understand that there is a lot of similarity between the current thinking in the United States and our policies," he said. Qureshi said that he in a letter addressed to the incoming Secretary of State Anthony Blinken tried to update him about the positive trajectory of Pakistan's policies with the idea of more talks on the issue of interests with him. "We have made a very big shift, from a geo-strategic position to a geo-economic position," he said, highlighting the focus of the current government to fix the ailing economy of the country. The statement came as Pakistan looked forward to build on the improvement in ties with Washington in the wake of peace agreement with the Taliban, which Islamabad claims it facilitated.  Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has already expressed his desire to work with the new American administration to deepen bilateral ties. "Look forward to working with @POTUS in building a stronger Pak-US partnership through trade and economic engagement, countering climate change, improving public health, combating corruption and promoting peace in the region and beyond," Khan tweeted while congratulating the new US President.

The India-Pakistan ties nose-dived in recent years with no bilateral talks taking place. India has not been engaging with Pakistan since an attack on the Air Force base at Pathankot in January of 2016 by a Pakistan-based terror group, maintaining that talks and terror cannot go together.

 MOSCOW: The Kremlin on Sunday accused the US embassy of interfering in Russia's domestic affairs after the mission distributed a "demonstration alert" to US citizens in Russia recommending they avoid protests. Nearly 3,500 protesters were arrested at demonstrations in support of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on Saturday, a monitor reported, as Russian authorities probed violence on the part of both protesters and police.  Police clashed with demonstrators in Moscow as tens of thousands took to the streets across the country on Saturday following Navalny's call to demonstrate against President Vladimir Putin's 20-year rule.  Ahead of the demonstrations, the US embassy issued a safety warning to Americans based in Russia.  "Of course, these publications are inappropriate," President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a state TV channel.  "And of course indirectly, they are absolutely an interference in our domestic affairs," he added.  He accused the US embassy of "indirectly" supporting the violation of Russian legislation and backing "unauthorised protests".  He said that if the Russian embassy in the United Sates issued similar information "this would cause a certain feeling of discomfort in Washington".  The Russian foreign ministry on Saturday said the representatives of the US embassy would be summoned and would have to "explain themselves".  A US mission spokeswoman earlier Sunday said US embassies and consulates around the world routinely issue safety messages to US citizens.  "This is a common, routine practice of many countries' diplomatic missions," she told AFP.  On Saturday, the US embassy in Moscow also said it was following the rallies, adding that Washington supported "the right of all people to peaceful protest, freedom of expression".  "Steps being taken by Russian authorities are suppressing those rights," embassy spokeswoman Rebecca Ross said on Twitter.

 ISLAMABAD: To overcome Pakistan's ailing economy, Prime Minister Imran Khan is considering mortgaging Islamabad's biggest park to get a loan of around Rs 500 billion. According to a report by Dawn, the proposal to mortgage the F-9 park to get a loan of around Rs 500 billion will be included in the agenda of the next meeting of the federal cabinet, scheduled to be held on Tuesday.  The meeting will be held via video conference arranged at the Prime Minister's House and a committee room of the Cabinet Division.  The F-9 park, named after Madar-i-Millat Fatima Jinnah. is stretched over 759 acres of land. It is one of the largest covered green areas in Pakistan.  Citing reports, Dawn highlighted that this decision has been taken due to the financial issues being faced by the government.  This comes amid declining relations of Pakistan with its two biggest sources of foreign remittances and foreign exchange - Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  Last August, Saudi Arabia asked Pakistan to repay early a $3 billion soft loan, Islamabad tried to defuse the tensions by quickly dispatching its current army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa. However, Saudi Arabia did not budge from its demand.  The UAE, which is Pakistan's second-largest source of foreign remittances, has recently banned issuing work visas for Pakistani workers.  Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi's recent visit to the UAE failed to lift the ban, to Islamabad's severe disappointment.

 FRANKFURT: Germany will become the first European Union country to start using the same experimental antibodies treatment credited with helping Donald Trump recover from Covid-19, health minister Jens Spahn said Sunday. The government has bought 200,000 doses for 400 million euros ($486 million)," Spahn told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper, working out at 2,000 euros per dose.  Patients will receive them free of charge, a health ministry spokeswoman told AFP.  Two different kinds of so-called monoclonal antibody therapies will be made available to university hospitals from the coming week, with Spahn saying Germany was "the first country in the EU" to deploy them in the fight against the pandemic.  Both treatments have been approved for emergency use in the United States but have yet to receive the green light from European regulators.  The ministry spokeswoman said Germany's national regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PIE), had determined that use of the drugs was "in principle" allowed on a case-by-case basis if doctors deemed it appropriate to prevent "severe illness or hospitalisations among certain risk groups".  Germany has purchased doses of US firm Regeneron's Casirivimab/Imdevimab antibody cocktail, as well US company Eli Lilly's Bamlanivimab antibody drug, she added.  Trump, who was briefly hospitalised with the coronavirus last October, was treated with Regeneron's therapy, before it had gained formal authorisation.  He later said the medicine did "a fantastic job".  Regeneron's version is a combination or "cocktail" of two lab-made antibodies: infection-fighting proteins that were developed to bind to the surface protein of the coronavirus to stop it from invading human cells.  Eli Lilly's therapy works in a similar way but uses a single synthetic antibody. "They work like a passive vaccination. Administering these antibodies in the early stages can help high-risk patients avoid a more serious progression," Spahn told Bild.  Germany's decision to use the drugs before the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has authorised them comes at a time of growing frustration over a slower-than-expected rollout of vaccines in the EU.  Vaccine makers Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca have both said they would be delivering fewer doses to Europe than anticipated in the short term because of production problems.  The German government has said it nonetheless expects to be able to offer all Germans a jab by the end of August.  Although Germany, the EU's most populous nation and its biggest economy, coped relatively well with the first coronavirus wave last spring, it has been hit hard by a resurgence in cases in recent months.  The emergence of new, more contagious strains has added to concerns.  The country has recorded over two million cases since the start of the pandemic, and more than 50,000 deaths.  Schools, non-essential shops, culture and leisure facilities are closed until February 14 in a bid to slow the infection rate, while companies have been urged to allow staff to work from home whenever possible.

 BEIJING: Rescuers in east China on Sunday pulled 11 miners from hundreds of metres underground where they had been trapped for two weeks, state media reported, as the race to locate the remaining 10 intensified. The miners were brought to the surface starting from around 11 am Sunday, state broadcaster CCTV reported -- a major breakthrough for a rescue operation that has captivated the nation. One miner was in "extremely weak physical condition" and rushed to hospital, CCTV said. The 11 miners were rescued after the air ventilator shaft was cleared, the official state news agency Xinhua reported, citing the operation's command centre. A further ten remain unaccounted for. Specialist teams have been battling difficult conditions since an explosion at the Hushan mine in Shandong province trapped the miners underground amid rising waters on January 10. The explosion occurred in a ventilator shaft, causing a blockage that damaged the cable car. On Sunday morning the huge obstacles suddenly fell to the bottom of the shaft, allowing the operation to take a big step forward, rescue expert Du Bingjian said. "After the obstacles fell to the bottom of the shaft, the rescue team started to bring up the miners and suspended the drilling work," Du told the Global Times. "It is currently unclear when the rescuers will reach the Sixth Central Section where the missing miners are believed to be." State broadcaster footage on Sunday showed a small elevator carriage lifted to the surface, accompanied by rescue workers. A masked man, who appeared unable to stand, was carried out. Later footage showed emergency workers lifting out other miners, who wore black shades to protect their eyes from the light. One appeared to be holding his hands as if praying. Contact was first established a week ago with a group of 11 miners trapped in a section of the mine around 580 metres (1,900 feet) below the surface. One of them was seriously injured in the initial explosion and died after falling into a coma. Another miner was found alive by rescuers as they attempted to reach the group. Rescue teams have been lowering food, medicine and other supplies to the group through several lifeline shafts drilled into the rock. State media reported Friday that the health of the miners had been gradually returning to a "normal state" after regular deliveries of food. Life detectors and nutrient solutions have been lowered to other parts of the mine in the hope of reaching those still missing. In December, 23 workers died after becoming stuck underground in the southwestern city of Chongqing.

 MUMBAI: Nearly a fortnight after Elon Muskâs Tesla entered India on January 8, his SpaceX on Sunday night broke a world space record by launching 143 satellites in quick succession, beating Indiaâs record of deploying 104 satellites in February 2017. The launch vehicle for the SpaceX record-breaking flight was the Falcon 9 and the mission was designated as Transporter-1. The lift-off at Cape Canaveral in Florida was at 8.31pm IST. At one point, the rocket flew over India and its signal was picked up by Isroâs Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network at Bengaluru. The launch marks the first dedicated mission for SpaceXâs SmallSat Rideshare Program, which enables small-satellite customers to book a ride to orbit with SpaceX directly. The 143 satellites launched on Sunday included commercial and government CubeSats, microsats, what are known as orbiter transfer vehicles and 10 Starlink satellites â the maximum number of spacecraft ever to be deployed in a single mission. This batch of Starlink satellites was the first in the constellation to be placed in the polar orbit. The nearly 90-minute deployment sequence of the satellites having different roles was nail-biting because they separated in a span of a few seconds and a minute. Onboard was also a spacecraft belonging to Nasa. With these satellites, SpaceX aims to provide near-global broadband internet coverage all over the world by 2021. About 10 minutes after lift-off, SpaceX recovered the first stage once again on the âOf Course I Still Love Youâ drone ship stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. Then, about an hour after liftoff, the payloads started deploying over the course of about 90 minutes. According to sources, SpaceX offered a very low price of $15,000 per kilogram for each satellite to be delivered to a polar sun-synchronous orbit.

 NEW YORK: The United States has surpassed 25 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic began. The new milestone, reported Sunday by Johns Hopkins University, is a grim reminder of the coronavirus' wide reach in the US, which has seen far more confirmed cases and deaths than any other country in the world. The US accounts for roughly one of every four cases reported worldwide and one of every five deaths. India has recorded the second most cases, with about 10.7 million. The number of new cases in the US has shown signs of slowing recently, with an average of 176,000 reported daily in the past week, down from 244,000 in early January. The country's first case of the infection was diagnosed almost exactly a year ago.

 Why Biden's immigration plan may be risky for Democrats

 WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden is confronting the political risk that comes with grand ambition. As one of his first acts, Biden offered a sweeping immigration overhaul last week that would provide a path to US citizenship for the estimated 11 million people who are in the United States illegally. It would also codify provisions wiping out some of President Donald Trump's signature hard-line policies, including trying to end existing, protected legal status for many immigrants brought to the US as children and crackdowns on asylum rules. It's precisely the type of measure that many Latino activists have longed for, particularly after the tough approach of the Trump era. But it must compete with Biden's other marquee legislative goals, including a $1.9 trillion plan to combat the coronavirus, an infrastructure package that promotes green energy initiatives and a âpublic optionâ to expand health insurance. In the best of circumstances, enacting such a broad range of legislation would be difficult. But in a narrowly divided Congress, it could be impossible. And that has Latinos, the nation's fastest growing voting bloc, worried that Biden and congressional leaders could cut deals that weaken the finished product too much â or fail to pass anything at all. âThis cannot be a situation where simply a visionary bill â a message bill â gets sent to Congress and nothing happens with it,â said Marielena HincapiÃ©, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, which advocates for low-income immigrants. âThere's an expectation that they will deliver and that there is a mandate now for Biden to be unapologetically pro-immigrant and have a political imperative to do so, and the Democrats do as well.â If Latinos ultimately feel betrayed, the political consequences for Democrats could be long-lasting. The 2020 election provided several warning signs that, despite Democratic efforts to build a multiracial coalition, Latino support could be at risk. Biden already was viewed skeptically by some Latino activists for his association with former President Barack Obama, who was called the âdeporter in chiefâ for the record number of immigrants who were removed from the country during his administration. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont defeated Biden in last year's Nevada caucuses and California primary, which served as early barometers of the Latino vote. In his race against Trump, Biden won the support of 63% of Latino voters compared with Trump's 35%, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 110,000 voters nationwide. But Trump narrowed the margin somewhat in some swing states such as Nevada and also got a bump from Latino men, 39% of whom backed him compared with 33% of Latino women. Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate since 1996 to carry Arizona, in part because of strong grassroots backing from Mexican American groups opposed to strict GOP immigration policies going back decades. But he lost Florida by underperforming in its largest Hispanic county, Miami-Dade, where the Trump campaign's anti-socialism message resonated with Cuban- and some Venezuelan Americans. Biden also fell short in Texas even though running mate Kamala Harris devoted valuable, late campaign time there. The ticket lost some sparsely populated but heavily Mexican American counties along the Mexican border, where law enforcement agencies are major employers and the GOP's zero-tolerance immigration policy resonated. There were more warning signs for House Democrats, who lost four California seats and two in South Florida while failing to pick up any in Texas. Booming Hispanic populations reflected in new U.S. census figures may see Texas and Florida gain congressional districts before 2022's midterm elections, which could make correcting the problem all the more pressing for Democrats. The urgency isn't lost on Biden. He privately spent months telling immigration advocates that major overhauls would be at the top of his to-do list. As vice president, he watched while the Obama administration used larger congressional majorities to speed passage of a financial crisis stimulus bill and its signature health care law while letting an immigration overhaul languish. âIt means so much to us to have a new president propose bold, visionary immigration reform on Day 1. Not Day 2. Not Day 3. Not a year later,â said New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, his chamber's lead sponsor of the Biden package. Menendez was part of a bipartisan immigration plan championed by the âGang of Eightâ senators that collapsed in 2013. Obama then resorted to executive action to offer legal status to millions of young immigrants. President George W. Bush also pushed an immigration package â with an eye toward boosting Latino support for Republicans before the 2008 election â only to see it fail in Congress. Menendez acknowledged that the latest bill will have to find at least 10 Republican senators' support to clear the 60-vote hurdle to reach the floor, and that he's âunder no illusions" how difficult that will be. Former Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a moderate Republican from Florida, said Biden may find some GOP support but probably will have to settle for far less than what's in his original proposal. âMany Republicans are worried about primary challenges,â Curbelo said, adding that Trump and his supporters' championing of immigration crackdowns means there's âpolitical peril there for Republicans.â

 WASHINGTON: The United States' commitment to Taiwan is "rock-solid", the State Department said late Saturday, as it warned that China's "attempts to intimidate" the island are a threat to regional peace. The comments are the first from Washington on relations with Taiwan since President Joe Biden's inauguration last week, and came on the same day Taipei reported multiple Chinese jets and bombers had flown into its air defence zone. A total of 15 Chinese aircraft including 12 fighter jets entered the southwestern corner of Taiwan's air defence identification zone, reporting a second day of incursions by the Chinese air force. Amid the incursion on the same day, a US aircraft carrier group led by the USS Theodore Roosevelt entered the South China Sea to promote "to ensure freedom of the seas, build partnerships that foster maritime security", the US military said on Sunday. US carrier group enters South China Sea amid Taiwan tensionsState Department spokesman Ned Price said it "notes with concern the pattern of ongoing PRC attempts to intimidate its neighbors, including Taiwan" and "urges Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan." The statement added that Washington would continue to work on "deepening" ties with democratic Taiwan. Taiwan split from China at the end of a civil war in 1949. Its 23 million people live under the constant threat of invasion by the mainland, whose leaders view the island as their territory and have vowed to one day take it. Washington diplomatically recognizes Beijing over Taipei, but remains the latter's most important unofficial ally and military backer. Beijing baulks at any official contacts with Taiwan and tries to keep the island diplomatically isolated. President Donald Trump embraced warmer ties with the island as he feuded with China on issues like trade and national security. Beijing has called for a reset in US-China ties under Biden and on Thursday warned the US to "cautiously and appropriately handle Taiwan issues to prevent harm to US-China relations". But the new US president is expected to remain tough on the superpower rival despite a softening of diplomatic tone. Protecting Taiwan has become a rare bipartisan issue, especially as Chinese President Xi Jinping has ramped up threats towards the island. Taiwan: Chinese jets made record 380 incursions in 2020Last year, Chinese airplanes made a record 380 incursions into Taiwan's air defence identification zone and there is little sign of a shift since Biden came to power. Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense said 13 People's Liberation Army aircraft, including eight bombers and four jets, entered its defense zone on Saturday. The New York Times said China also sent 15 planes - including 12 fighters - into the zone on Sunday. In a tweet on Sunday, Taipei's ministry of foreign affairs thanked the US for its statement of support "in the face of Beijing's ongoing coercion." There was no immediate response from Beijing on Sunday. In a subtle but symbolic gesture, Taiwan's de facto ambassador to the US was formally invited to Biden's inauguration in what Taipei said was a precedent-setting first since Washington switched recognition to Beijing in 1979. The US statement on Saturday noted that Washington would "continue to assist Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defence capability".

 ISLAMABAD: To overcome Pakistan's ailing economy, Prime Minister Imran Khan is considering mortgaging Islamabad's biggest park to get a loan of around Rs 500 billion. According to a report by Dawn, the proposal to mortgage the F-9 park to get a loan of around Rs 500 billion will be included in the agenda of the next meeting of the federal cabinet, scheduled to be held on Tuesday.  The meeting will be held via video conference arranged at the Prime Minister's House and a committee room of the Cabinet Division.  The F-9 park, named after Madar-i-Millat Fatima Jinnah. is stretched over 759 acres of land. It is one of the largest covered green areas in Pakistan.  Citing reports, Dawn highlighted that this decision has been taken due to the financial issues being faced by the government.  This comes amid declining relations of Pakistan with its two biggest sources of foreign remittances and foreign exchange - Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  Last August, Saudi Arabia asked Pakistan to repay early a $3 billion soft loan, Islamabad tried to defuse the tensions by quickly dispatching its current army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa. However, Saudi Arabia did not budge from its demand.  The UAE, which is Pakistan's second-largest source of foreign remittances, has recently banned issuing work visas for Pakistani workers.  Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi's recent visit to the UAE failed to lift the ban, to Islamabad's severe disappointment.

 ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said on Sunday that his country was ready to work with the new US administration and asserted that the world has changed a lot in the last four years and any engagement and relations should be developed on the basis of new ground realities. Under the Trump administration, the relations between Pakistan and the US were chaotic as well as complex. "In (these) four years the world has changed, the region has changed and Pakistan has changed and you have to engage with this new Pakistan," Qureshi said while addressing a press conference in Multan. He said that the Pakistan government was ready to work with the new US government and hoped that the Biden administration would be guided by a "new approach and new policy guidelines." "I understand that there is a lot of similarity between the current thinking in the United States and our policies," he said. Qureshi said that he in a letter addressed to the incoming Secretary of State Anthony Blinken tried to update him about the positive trajectory of Pakistan's policies with the idea of more talks on the issue of interests with him. "We have made a very big shift, from a geo-strategic position to a geo-economic position," he said, highlighting the focus of the current government to fix the ailing economy of the country. The statement came as Pakistan looked forward to build on the improvement in ties with Washington in the wake of peace agreement with the Taliban, which Islamabad claims it facilitated.  Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has already expressed his desire to work with the new American administration to deepen bilateral ties. "Look forward to working with @POTUS in building a stronger Pak-US partnership through trade and economic engagement, countering climate change, improving public health, combating corruption and promoting peace in the region and beyond," Khan tweeted while congratulating the new US President.

The India-Pakistan ties nose-dived in recent years with no bilateral talks taking place. India has not been engaging with Pakistan since an attack on the Air Force base at Pathankot in January of 2016 by a Pakistan-based terror group, maintaining that talks and terror cannot go together.

 ISLAMABAD: The United Nations has cautioned staff of all its agencies across the world against using any Pakistan-registered airline, including the national flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), due to concerns about the dubious flying licences of its pilots. The news about fake licenses of PIA pilots was revealed by the countryâs aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan on the floor of the National Assembly last year in July. An advisory issued by the UN Security Management System (UNSMS), stated: âDue to an ongoing investigation of the CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) Pakistanâ¦due to dubious licenses caution is advised on the use of Pakistan-registered air operators.â The UN advisory against flying on Pakistan-registered carriers was recommended to all the UN agencies, including the UN Development Programme, World Health Organization, UN High Commission for Refugees, Food and Agriculture Organization, UN Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization and others. It signifies that UN officials working in Pakistan cannot travel by any Pakistan-registered airline even domestically. The Pakistan-registered airlines listed in the advisory include PIA, Air Eagle, Air Indus, Air Blue, Aircraft Sales and Services, Askari Aviation, Hawk Adventure Air, Hybrid Aviation, IAMC Airline, Meezab Aviation, Rayyan Air, Serene Air, Star Air Aviation and Vision Air International. The UNSMS has allowed its personnel to travel even by the Afghanistan-registered Kam Air. However, it noted that Afghanistan has an under-performing civil aviation authority as per the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO)âs audit programme, but the airline is authorised to conduct flight operations into multiple international airports. It is subject to an external audit. The advisory said that the air operator information is the result of a newly launched automated system, linked to a newly revised methodology and global air travel safety policy. Information and analysis generated by the Commercial Air Travel Safety Unit (CATSU) in relation to aviation safety is intended for UNSMS use only and is confidential. Such information may be shared with other UN recipients and third parties strictly on a need-to-know basis and provided suitable mechanisms are in place to maintain confidentiality. The advisory was issued sometime after the Pakistan aviation minister had dropped a bombshell alleging that hundreds of Pakistani pilots had dubious licences. Additionally, Pakistan has paid around $7 million to the Peregrine Aviation Charlie Ltd in the case pertaining to two jets leased to it by the Dublin-based AerCap. Itâs over the same case that the Malaysian authorities last Friday seized a PIA Boeing-777 at the Kuala Lumpur airport on the orders of a local court over the non-payment of aircraft lease dues owed to the AerCap.

 KATHMANDU: The ruling Nepal Communist Party's splinter faction led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal âPrachanda' on Sunday expelled Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli from the party's general membership. The decision to remove Oli from the party's general membership was taken at the Standing Committee meeting of the faction led by former prime ministers Prachanda and Madhav Kumar Nepal after Oli failed to produce explanation to his recent moves as sought by party leadership, sources said. Earlier in December, the splinter group had removed Oli, one of the two chairmen of the ruling party, as the party chair. Madhav Nepal was named as the party's second chairman. Prachanda is the first chairman of the party. The Prachanda-led faction on January 15 sought clarification from Oli alleging that he was carrying out activities that go against the party's policies. The faction decided to strip Oli off even from the ordinary membership of the party after he chose not to furnish any clarification, party sources said. Oli had been accused of violating party statute by the splinter group. The latest political development came two days after the NCP's splinter faction led a massive anti-government rally, saying the "unconstitutional" dissolution of the Parliament by Prime Minister Oli has posed serious threats to the country's hard-earned federal democratic republic system. Prachanda last week said that by dissolving the House, Oli has given a blow to the Constitution as well as the democratic republic system which has been established in the country through seven decades of struggle by the people. Madhav Nepal, who last month replaced Oli as the chairman of the party by Prachanda-led faction, said that the Constitution has not given rights to the prime minister to dissolve Parliament. Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 after Oli, known for his pro-China leanings, in a surprise move dissolved Parliament, amidst a tussle for power with Prachanda. His move to dissolve the 275-member House, sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by Prachanda, also a co-chair of the ruling party. Oli, who is the chairperson of a faction of the NCP, has said he was forced to dissolve the House after knowing that the Prachanda-led faction was planning to file a no-confidence motion against him and introduce an impeachment motion against President Bidya Devi Bhandari. Oli-led CPN-UML and Prachanda-led NCP (Maoist Centre) merged in May 2018 to form a unified Nepal Communist Party following victory of their alliance in the 2017 general elections. After a vertical split in the ruling party following the dissolution of the House, both the factions, one led by Oli and another led by Prachanda, have submitted separate applications at the Election Commission claiming that their faction is the genuine party and asked to provide them the election symbol of the party. However, the Election Commission is yet to decide the matter. In December, China sent a four-member high-level delegation to Nepal to prevent a split within the NCP. The team - led by a Vice minister of the Chinese Communist Party, Guo Yezhou - held separate meetings with several top NCP leaders before returning home without much success in its mission. India has described Oli's sudden decision to dissolve Parliament and call for fresh elections as an "internal matter" that is for the country to decide as per its democratic processes.

 DHAKA: Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has thanked her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for sending over two million doses of Covid-19 vaccine as a gift to Bangladesh. India on Thursday officially handed over 2 million doses of domestically produced Covishield vaccine to Bangladesh. The vaccines were provided at a crucial time when the number of coronavirus cases in Bangladesh is rising. "I thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi for sending the vaccine (batch) as a gift," Hasina said at an online international conference held on the occasion of the 100th founding anniversary of the University of Dhaka on Thursday.  She said the government has already planned how it would proceed with the vaccine, the Dhaka Tribune reported.  "We have taken all the steps to face the Covid-19 situation in the country," Hasina said.  Apart from the current delivery of vaccines, Bangladesh is also set to purchase 3 crore doses of India-made coronavirus vaccine. Hasina hoped that the vaccine that Bangladesh procured from India would arrive by January 25-26, the report said. Bangladesh has so far recorded 7,966 Covid-19 deaths since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year, while the total number of infections have surged to over 530,270.  India also handed over 1 million doses of coronavirus vaccines to Nepal on Thursday. On Wednesday, India sent 150,000 doses of Covishield vaccines to Bhutan and 100,000 doses to the Maldives.

 As vaccines gifted by India reached Kathmandu and Dhaka on Thursday, it was the culmination of a series of steps by the government to keep the focus on the immediate neighbourhood as the world struggled with a pandemic. On Friday, a consignment containing 1.5 million doses of Covishield vaccines will reach Yangon, Myanmar. On Thursday, one million doses of vaccines landed in Nepal and 2 million doses landed in Dhaka. Except for Sri Lanka and Afghanistan (which have not yet given regulatory clearances), India has supplied the first doses of vaccines to almost all its immediate neighbours. Interestingly, Pakistan gave emergency authorisation to the AstraZeneca vaccine last week, but itâs not yet clear where it would source the vaccine from. Beyond the immediate neighbourhood, India is also looking to provide Covid-19 vaccine to important defence and security partners in the Indian Ocean with a consignment of 100,000 doses likely to reach Mauritius, and another 50,000 doses to Seychelles, on Friday. India has already donated Covishield vaccine to Sri Lanka and Maldives. âIndiaâs vaccine diplomacy demonstrates Indiaâs role as a reliable partner and a net provider of humanitarian assistance in the Indian Ocean region,â said a source.

 London: UK prime minister Boris Johnson is believed to be the first world leader outside North America and the third leader in the world to get a call from the new US president Joe Biden, in what is seen as a significant boost to UK-US relations post Brexit. The two leaders spoke on Saturday and vowed to deepen the special relationship between the US and Britain and drive a green and sustainable recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. They also discussed the benefits of a potential free trade deal between the two countries and the need for coordination on shared foreign policy priorities, including China, Iran, and Russia. The call to the UK prime minister follows Bidenâs first two calls after entering the White House which he made to Canadian PM Justin Trudeau and Mexican president AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador on Friday. This makes Johnson the first leader outside North America to get the coveted phone call â ahead of the likes of German chancellor Angela Merkel and Irish PM MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin. Biden has Irish roots. In its readout of the call, the White House has said the US president conveyed his intention to strengthen the special relationship between the two countries and revitalise transatlantic ties, underscoring the critical role of NATO to the UK and USAâs collective defence and shared values. Biden noted the importance of cooperation, including through multilateral organisations, on shared challenges such as combating climate change, containing COVID-19, and ensuring global health security. Johnson tweeted a photo of the call in which he is wearing an open-neck shirt, with his sleeves rolled up, looking relaxed and jovial, standing up in his office at 10 Downing Street chatting to Biden. His tweet said: âGreat to speak to President @JoeBiden this evening. I look forward to deepening the longstanding alliance between our two countries as we drive a green and sustainable recovery from COVID-19.â Former US president Donald Trump had relegated former UK prime minister Theresa May to 11th in the list of world leaders he rang following his election victory in November 2016. A Downing Street spokesperson said: âThe Prime Minister congratulated the President on his inauguration and the two leaders noted the significant challenges facing the world during the pandemic, but also the unparalleled opportunities to build back better and greener togetherâ. The UK prime minister praised Bidenâs early action on tackling climate change and commitment to reach Net Zero by 2050. âThe Prime Minister warmly welcomed the Presidentâs decision to re-join the Paris Agreement on climate change, as well as the World Health Organization and the COVAX programme to ensure equitable access for vaccines,â Number 10 said. Building on their countryâs long history of cooperation in security and defence, the leaders re-committed to the NATO alliance and their shared values in promoting human rights and protecting democracy. âThey also discussed the benefits of a potential free trade deal between our two countries, and the Prime Minister reiterated his intention to resolve existing trade issues as soon as possible,â Downing Street added. Both leaders said they looked forward to meeting in person as soon as the circumstances allow, and closely working together through the G7, G20 and United Nations climate change conference, COP26. Indian PM Narendra Modi will be attending the G7 summit in Carbis Bay, Cornwall in Britain from 11 to 13 June. The UK will host the COP26 Summit in Glasgow in November, which follows on from the G20 summit in Rome at the end of October.

 LONDON: A nasal spray which can prevent a coronavirus infection for up to two days is being prepped for mass production by scientists at the University of Birmingham with the hope of having them available over-the-counter in pharmacies in a few months, a UK newspaper report said on Sunday. Dr Richard Moakes, the study's lead researcher, told 'The Sunday Telegraph' that he is confident in the spray's formula to help unlock society from social distancing restrictions and "get schools going again". The nasal spray, which has not yet been named, is made from ingredients that are already approved for medical use, meaning it is safe for use by humans and does not require further approval. The formula helps prevent infection by capturing the virus in the nose and encapsulating it in a coating which it cannot escape from. As a result, it would be safe for a person to breathe out - even if inhaled by another person - because the virus would be inactive and harmless, the newspaper reports. "As an over the shelf product, we have spoken to companies with a presence on the high street as we think they could distribute it effectively," Moakes was quoted as saying. "Based on the product, it will be much quicker to get to the user than a novel drug. I am confident that the formulation can make an impact. Our goal is to make an impact as soon as possible, we would really like to see this happen by summer," he said. In November last year, the researchers working on the spray since April 2020 announced that laboratory experiments showed the spray prevented a coronavirus infection from spreading for up to 48 hours. The team believes using the spray four times a day would be enough for general protection, although it is safe enough to be applied every 20 minutes if in a high-risk, densely populated environment such as schools. The spray is a combination of an antiviral agent called carrageenan, commonly used in foods as a thickening agent, and a solution called gellan - a gelling agent selected for its ability to stick to cells inside the nose. Gellan is an important component because it has the ability to be sprayed into fine droplets inside the nasal cavity, where it can cover the surface evenly and stay at the delivery site rather than sliding downwards and out of the nose.

 LONDON: AugustaWestland chopper scam accused British national Christian Michel who has been languishing in Tihar Jail for two years has written a handwritten letter to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, foreign secretary Dominic Raab and home secretary Priti Patel calling on the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) to intervene in his case, claiming his extradition from Dubai to India was politically-motivated and that he has been tortured. In the 35-page correspondence, which his lawyer, Toby Cadman, of Guernica 37 International Justice Chambers, released on Saturday, Michel, 54, sets out his dismay at the failings of the British government to help and claims he was handed over to the Indian authorities âunlawfullyâ by the UAE âas part of a quid pro quo for the return of Sheikha Latifaâ. In March 2018, the 35-year-old daughter of Dubaiâs billionaire ruler was intercepted on a yacht about 50 miles off the coast of Goa in a joint India-UAE operation and sent back to Dubai. Michel was extradited from Dubai to India on December 4, 2018. In the letter, dated January 7, Michel writes that the first request for his extradition from the UAE to India failed and the second request âcoincided with the handing over of Sheikha Latifa to Dubai by the Indian authoritiesâ. He states that the Indian government âreinstated the extradition procedureâ two days after a meeting took place between him and a senior CBI official in May 2018 after he ârefused to cooperate in signing a 20-page confession incriminating himselfâ. A UK government spokesperson said: âOur staff continue to support a British man who has been detained in Delhi since 2018 and regularly raise his case with the Indian authorities. The Foreign Secretary raised it with Indiaâs Minister of External Affairs, Dr Jaishankar, during his visit to India in December 2020. Minister of State for South Asia and the Commonwealth, Lord (Tariq) Ahmad of Wimbledon has met with his family based in the UK, and we continue to provide them with updates on his case. Michel also claims that whilst imprisoned in Dubai, awaiting extradition, he was prevented from accessing his lawyer and denied private consular access. In Tihar jail, he claims he has been subjected to ârepeated and prolonged interrogations aimed at securing a confession by way of duressâ, as well as âinhuman or degrading treatment thatâ¦ constitutes torture.â In April 2019, Cadman filed an urgent communication with the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and with the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture against both the UAE and India with regard to Michel. âWe fully expect the UN Working Group to rule that Christian is being arbitrarily detained and recommend his immediate release. That ruling is imminent,â he said. âThe process that led to his removal from the UAE was a politically motivated decision. This extradition process can only be defined as a political extradition or better, a political rendition. The complete lack of due process is utterly unacceptable. He has been detained in conditions that can only be described in flagrant breach of the fundamental guarantees under national and international law. The FCDO must take immediate steps to intervene,â Cadman said. Michel is accused of bribing and criminally conspiring with Indian officials to win a contract on behalf of British helicopter manufacturer AgustaWestland for 12 VVIP helicopters in 2010 and of receiving Rs 375 crore (â¬ 42.27million) in kickbacks for securing the deal.

 FRANKFURT: Germany will become the first European Union country to start using the same experimental antibodies treatment credited with helping Donald Trump recover from Covid-19, health minister Jens Spahn said Sunday. The government has bought 200,000 doses for 400 million euros ($486 million)," Spahn told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper, working out at 2,000 euros per dose.  Patients will receive them free of charge, a health ministry spokeswoman told AFP.  Two different kinds of so-called monoclonal antibody therapies will be made available to university hospitals from the coming week, with Spahn saying Germany was "the first country in the EU" to deploy them in the fight against the pandemic.  Both treatments have been approved for emergency use in the United States but have yet to receive the green light from European regulators.  The ministry spokeswoman said Germany's national regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PIE), had determined that use of the drugs was "in principle" allowed on a case-by-case basis if doctors deemed it appropriate to prevent "severe illness or hospitalisations among certain risk groups".  Germany has purchased doses of US firm Regeneron's Casirivimab/Imdevimab antibody cocktail, as well US company Eli Lilly's Bamlanivimab antibody drug, she added.  Trump, who was briefly hospitalised with the coronavirus last October, was treated with Regeneron's therapy, before it had gained formal authorisation.  He later said the medicine did "a fantastic job".  Regeneron's version is a combination or "cocktail" of two lab-made antibodies: infection-fighting proteins that were developed to bind to the surface protein of the coronavirus to stop it from invading human cells.  Eli Lilly's therapy works in a similar way but uses a single synthetic antibody. "They work like a passive vaccination. Administering these antibodies in the early stages can help high-risk patients avoid a more serious progression," Spahn told Bild.  Germany's decision to use the drugs before the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has authorised them comes at a time of growing frustration over a slower-than-expected rollout of vaccines in the EU.  Vaccine makers Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca have both said they would be delivering fewer doses to Europe than anticipated in the short term because of production problems.  The German government has said it nonetheless expects to be able to offer all Germans a jab by the end of August.  Although Germany, the EU's most populous nation and its biggest economy, coped relatively well with the first coronavirus wave last spring, it has been hit hard by a resurgence in cases in recent months.  The emergence of new, more contagious strains has added to concerns.  The country has recorded over two million cases since the start of the pandemic, and more than 50,000 deaths.  Schools, non-essential shops, culture and leisure facilities are closed until February 14 in a bid to slow the infection rate, while companies have been urged to allow staff to work from home whenever possible.

 Czech trainers teach dogs to sniff out Covid

 KLINY, Czech Republic: In a dog training centre built inside a shipping container located in a Czech mountain village, Renda, Cap and Laky are being put to the test. They sniff at six vessels, each containing a piece of cloth with scent from patients with Covid-19, negative donors, or fake samples. "Good boy!" exclaims Lenka Vlachova, a trainer working at Prague's fire brigade, as jagdterrier Renda sits down by one sample, wagging his tail. The team of dog trainers are working in their own time and report a 95-percent success rate in Covid-19 detection in samples of human scent. "The study is designed to verify dogs' ability to detect Covid-19 and generate a method enabling the use of trained dogs in combatting the pandemic," project head Gustav Hotovy told AFP. "The method should also work with other diseases, even more lethal than Covid-19," Hotovy said. "In the end, we should be able to detect a huge number of people in a very short time with a trained dog," he said, speaking in the snowy village of Kliny near the German border. Vlachova told AFP the first study confirming dogs are able to detect tissue attacked by a virus was conducted in the United States about a decade ago. "The virus changes the human tissue, affecting the scent signature of the person," she said. Hotovy, a retired cynologist whose team started training the dogs last August, said that the signature changes "so much that it is immediately discernible for the dogs". The samples used are obtained merely by rubbing a piece of cotton against the patient's skin. The team then has to ensure the sample is virus-free to prevent the dogs from catching the disease. Using the same sampling method, a Finnish team has been using dogs for testing at Helsinki airport, reporting its dogs can detect the virus with close to 100 percent accuracy. Vlachova said the Czechs would like to work together with the Finns or with French and German teams working on similar projects. Unlike their western peers, the Czech team works in its free time and relies on scant financial means provided by a local dog food maker. Cynologist Katerina Jancarikova said the virus-affected tissue made up "just a tiny fragment in the overall scent, a part of the dogs' puzzle". "It's like looking for Wally," she said, referring to the popular children's books in which a tiny character in red and white stripes has to be found in pictures of a huge crowd. Jancarikova said any dog can be trained for detection as long as it is cooperative. As Vlachova led Renda back to the van, Hotovy walked into the training centre with a sturdy giant schnauzer named Laky who eagerly sniffed at the vessels, placed in a different pattern, before easily identifying the positive one. "He was once reluctant to cooperate," he chuckled, adding that the dogs showed the same eager response when let loose in a nearby house where a guest who tested positive for Covid-19 had been staying. "They immediately jumped at his bed with the same happy reaction they show over a positive sample in the centre," he said.

 PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron said Saturday the law had to change to better protect victims of child sexual abuse, after thousands shared their stories in response to a newly published book. "Today shame is switching sides" from victims to perpetrators, Macron said in a video posted to Twitter, welcoming the fact that "people feel free to speak everywhere in France". The flood of testimony under the social media hashtag #Metooinceste followed the early January publication of a book, "La familia grande", by Camille Kouchner. In it she accused her step-father, prominent political commentator Olivier Duhamel, of having abused her twin brother. Macron did not directly address that case. But in a short video posted to Twitter, he promised those speaking out online: "We are here. We're listening to you. We believe you. And you will never be alone again." And he added: "We have to adapt our laws to better protect child victims of incest and sexual violence." Promising to "punish criminals for their acts in the past and prevent them ever reoffending", Macron said the law would be updated. In 2018, France already pushed back the statute of limitations for sexual crimes against minors to 30 years. But some people have argued such acts should never fall beyond the reach of the justice system. "No-one can ignore these experiences any longer," Macron said. "We have to hear and gather victims' testimonies even years, decades afterwards."

 PARIS: Portuguese voters have been asked to venture out despite the country's pandemic lockdown Sunday for a presidential election widely expected to see centre-right incumbent Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa win another term. Polls point to a first-round win for Rebelo de Sousa, a former political commentator turned approachable head of state known for candid moments like queueing at the supermarket in shorts, plunging into the sea to help girls whose canoe had capsized or sharing a meal with homeless people. But observers have their eye on how a far-right challenger will perform -- and whether a plunge in turnout could produce an upset. At stake is a post with the power to dissolve parliament and call fresh elections -- a pivotal constitutional role with a minority government in power. Portugal has been under a second national lockdown for the past 10 days aimed at braking a surge in coronavirus cases. The country recorded its worst daily coronavirus death toll and number of new infections on Saturday bringing fatalities to over 10,000. More than 80,000 infections were reported in the past week to Friday, the highest rate worldwide in proportion to its 10.8 million people, according to an AFP tally based on government figures. Almost every new day brings a fresh record in case numbers, and the government has now shut schools for two weeks on top of shops and restaurants. In his final campaign speech, Rebelo de Sousa -- one of the rare politicians often referred to simply by his first name -- urged voters to back him so as to avoid a second round. That would "spare the Portuguese people from the election being stretched out over three crucial weeks" -- time that could be better spent slowing the pandemic, the former minister and co-founder of the centre-right Social Democratic Party (PSD) said. "An abstention rate of 70 percent would be enough to make a second round almost unavoidable," the 72-year-old warned. Lower turnout could also upset the expected easy win for Rebelo de Sousa, with polls giving him 58 percent of the first-round vote -- far ahead of socialist challenger Ana Gomes and far-right populist Andre Ventura, on 15 and 10 percent. A first-round re-election would fit in with Portugal's experience since adopting democratic government in 1974, with all four of the president's predecessors securing a second five-year term this way. Nevertheless, in a long political career "I've seen more failures than victories, so I keep things in perspective", "Marcelo" said recently when asked if he hadn't been campaigning hard enough. "When I lost it wasn't the end of the world. And when I won, I didn't think I was the best." Rebelo de Sousa's popularity with voters has not suffered from his indulgence of Prime Minister Antonio Costa's socialist minority government. He is so well-liked that the socialist party didn't even bother putting up a candidate, denying its backing to 66-year-old Gomes, a former diplomat and European lawmaker turned anti-corruption activist. Meanwhile Ventura, the 38-year-old founder of right-wing populist party Chega -- "Enough" -- says he is in the running to "crush the Left", which is fielding three out of the seven candidates. Portugal has so far been largely spared the anti-establishment surges from the right that have reshaped the political landscape in many larger EU nations in recent years. Ventura secured his party's first and only parliamentary seat at 2019 legislative elections, winning the backing of 70,000 voters or 1.3 percent.

 WASHINGTON: The United States' commitment to Taiwan is "rock-solid", the State Department said late Saturday, as it warned that China's "attempts to intimidate" the island are a threat to regional peace. The comments are the first from Washington on relations with Taiwan since President Joe Biden's inauguration last week, and came on the same day Taipei reported multiple Chinese jets and bombers had flown into its air defence zone. A total of 15 Chinese aircraft including 12 fighter jets entered the southwestern corner of Taiwan's air defence identification zone, reporting a second day of incursions by the Chinese air force. Amid the incursion on the same day, a US aircraft carrier group led by the USS Theodore Roosevelt entered the South China Sea to promote "to ensure freedom of the seas, build partnerships that foster maritime security", the US military said on Sunday. US carrier group enters South China Sea amid Taiwan tensionsState Department spokesman Ned Price said it "notes with concern the pattern of ongoing PRC attempts to intimidate its neighbors, including Taiwan" and "urges Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan." The statement added that Washington would continue to work on "deepening" ties with democratic Taiwan. Taiwan split from China at the end of a civil war in 1949. Its 23 million people live under the constant threat of invasion by the mainland, whose leaders view the island as their territory and have vowed to one day take it. Washington diplomatically recognizes Beijing over Taipei, but remains the latter's most important unofficial ally and military backer. Beijing baulks at any official contacts with Taiwan and tries to keep the island diplomatically isolated. President Donald Trump embraced warmer ties with the island as he feuded with China on issues like trade and national security. Beijing has called for a reset in US-China ties under Biden and on Thursday warned the US to "cautiously and appropriately handle Taiwan issues to prevent harm to US-China relations". But the new US president is expected to remain tough on the superpower rival despite a softening of diplomatic tone. Protecting Taiwan has become a rare bipartisan issue, especially as Chinese President Xi Jinping has ramped up threats towards the island. Taiwan: Chinese jets made record 380 incursions in 2020Last year, Chinese airplanes made a record 380 incursions into Taiwan's air defence identification zone and there is little sign of a shift since Biden came to power. Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense said 13 People's Liberation Army aircraft, including eight bombers and four jets, entered its defense zone on Saturday. The New York Times said China also sent 15 planes - including 12 fighters - into the zone on Sunday. In a tweet on Sunday, Taipei's ministry of foreign affairs thanked the US for its statement of support "in the face of Beijing's ongoing coercion." There was no immediate response from Beijing on Sunday. In a subtle but symbolic gesture, Taiwan's de facto ambassador to the US was formally invited to Biden's inauguration in what Taipei said was a precedent-setting first since Washington switched recognition to Beijing in 1979. The US statement on Saturday noted that Washington would "continue to assist Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defence capability".

 BEIJING: China's capitalBeijing has issued a yellow alert for heavy air pollution which took effect from Sunday, prompting officials to take a series of steps to contain the smog.  A series of measures will be taken from Sunday, including the suspension of a number of outdoor construction operations, and halting or restricting production by manufacturing companies, the municipal air pollution emergency response office said.  The capital's air quality is expected to gradually improve on Tuesday, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.  Under China's four-tier warning system for air pollution, red is the most severe followed by orange, yellow and blue.  The Chinese capital, which for over a decade has acquired notoriety for heavy pollution especially in winter, has reported a considerable improvement in the last few years.  Beijing reported a 53-per cent decrease in PM 2.5 density in the past five years, achieving the goal set for the city's 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020), according to local authorities.  The city's PM 2.5 density was reduced by over a half in 2020 compared to that of 2015, giving the capital city the lowest density and sharpest decline in PM 2.5 within the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the nearby areas, data released by the Beijing Municipal People's Congress said on Saturday.  The average concentration of PM 2.5 in the metropolis was 38 micrograms per cubic meter in 2020, a year-on-year decline of 9.5 per cent and the lowest measurement since the data was first collected in 2013.  The improved air quality marked a step closer to meeting the level-2 national standard for PM 2.5 control, which is 35 micrograms per cubic meter, it said.  The PM 2.5 reading is a gauge monitoring airborne particles of 2.5 microns or less in diameter, which can penetrate deep into people's lungs.  Beijing also lowered its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by over 23 per cent during the same period.  It plans to plant 10,000 hectares of trees in 2021 in a bid to raise the municipality's forest coverage to about 45 per cent in the next five years.

 One year ago this week, the Chinese Communist Party was on the verge of its biggest crisis in decades. The coronavirus had brought the city of Wuhan to a halt. In the following days, the governmentâs efforts to conceal the pandemic would become public, sparking an online backlash of the kind the Chinese internet hadnât seen in years. Then, as the blows landed faster than the Chinese propaganda machine seemingly could handle, a number of liberal-minded Chinese began to think the unthinkable. Perhaps this tragedy would impel the Chinese people to push back. After decades of thought control and worsening censorship, perhaps this was the moment that the worldâs largest and most powerful propaganda machine would crack. It wasnât. A year later, the partyâs control of the narrative has become absolute. In Beijingâs telling, Wuhan stands not as a testament to Chinaâs weaknesses but to its strengths. Memories of the horrors of last year seem to be fading, at least judging by whatâs online. Even moderate dissent gets shouted down. People in China should be bowing their heads this week in memory of those who suffered and died. Instead, the China internet is afire over the scandal of a Chinese actress and her surrogate babies, a tabloid controversy egged on by Chinese propaganda. Anyone looking for lessons about China in the coming years needs to understand the consequences of what happened in 2020. The tragedy showed Beijing has the ability to control what people in China see, hear and think to a degree that surpasses even what pessimists believed. During the next crisis â whether it be disaster, war or financial crisis â the party has shown it has the tools to rally the people, no matter how ham-handedly Beijing deals with it. This week I looked through my Chinese social media timelines and screenshots from a year ago. I was shocked by how many posts, articles, photos and videos have been removed. I was also surprised to remember the sense of hope at that moment despite intense anger and grief. The shift was especially palpable the night that Dr Li Wenliang, who was silenced after warning of the outbreak in late 2019, died of the virus. That night, numerous Chinese people waged what amounted to an online revolt. They posted videos of the âLes MisÃ©rablesâ song âDo You Hear the People Sing?â They shared one of Liâs quotes repeatedly: âA healthy society should not have just one voice.â Even one of Chinaâs propaganda directives warned that Liâs death was an âunprecedented challenge.â Young people told me that the official news media had lost credibility. One of my followers on Weibo, the Chinese social media platform, apologized for attacking me before. I used to think that people like you were evil, he wrote. Now, he added, I know that we were fooled. A middle-age intellectual told me that he expected the population of liberal-minded Chinese people â those who want greater freedom from Beijingâs controls â to expand from his estimate of 5% to 10% of the total population to 30% to 40%. As these hopes rose, others tried to tamp down enthusiasm. One political scientist guessed the share of liberal-minded Chinese internet users would shrink, not grow. In three months, she predicted, the Chinese public would be celebrating the glorious victory over the outbreak under the leadership of the great Communist government. Unfortunately, she was correct. To reclaim the narrative in the early days of the pandemic, as my colleagues have reported, the Chinese government began a tremendous behind-the-scene effort to make sure that the censors took control at even the most local level. They listened and read just about everything people posted. Then the censors either addressed the problems or silenced the dissenters. Chinese officials say the police investigated or otherwise dealt with more than 17,000 people who they said had fabricated or spread fake pandemic-related information. After 11 weeks, the lockdown in Wuhan ended. By the summer, a photo of a crowded Wuhan swimming pool appeared on the homepages of many websites around the world. China emerged as a success story while the infection cases and death tolls in the United States and many other Western countries skyrocketed. The contrast made the effectiveness of the partyâs strong hand an easy sell. The Chinese Communist Party has a long history of controlling history. In the United States, historical narratives shift and compete, leading to arguments and sometimes even violence, but constantly illuminating new perspectives and bringing greater understanding of what underpins the national identity. In China, by contrast, the government has successfully taught its people that the country is nearly ungovernable unless a strong hand controls the narrative. The Communist Party has strict narratives about its most serious mistakes, including the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution and the Tiananmen Square crackdown. Immediately after the Cultural Revolution, the so-called scar literature â memoir-style novels by those who suffered during that troubled time â became a popular genre. The party quickly realized the danger of letting the public share its individual traumas and banned the books. Under Xi Jinping, the party has become even less tolerant of unorthodox historical ideas. In 2016, Yanhuang Chunqiu, a monthly history magazine in which moderate-minded retired officials published articles, was forced to surrender its editorial power to the authorities. The narrative about the current pandemic is no exception. Journalists, writers and bloggers whose portrayals of the outbreak differ from the official version have been jailed, disappeared or silenced. Fang Fang, a Wuhan-based novelist, became the most vilified figure on the Chinese internet in 2020. Her crime? Documenting her lockdown experiences in an apolitical account in an online diary. People online call her a liar, a traitor, a villain and an imperialist dog. They accuse her of maligning the government and causing the Chinese people to lose face in the world by publishing an English translation of her diary in the United States. One man called on the government to investigate her for the crime of subverting the state power. One high-ranking medical scientist chastised her for lacking patriotic emotions. No publisher is willing or able to publish her works in China. The social media posts and articles that support her are often censored. A few people who spoke up for her publicly were punished, including a literature professor in Wuhan who lost her Communist Party membership and her right to teach. âI think Fang Fang wrote about what happened,â said Amy Ye, the organizer of a volunteer group for disabled people in Wuhan. âIn fact, I donât think she included the most serious situations. Her diary is very moderate. I donât understand why even something like that couldnât be tolerated.â This demand for a single narrative carries risks. It silences those who might warn the government before it does something foolish, like stumble into a conflict or interfere with Chinaâs economic growth machine. It also conceals the true feelings of the Chinese people. On the street, in person, most Chinese will be happy to tell you whatâs on their minds, perhaps in exhaustive details. But China became a more opaque place in 2020. Online censorship became even harsher. Few Chinese people are willing to take the risks of speaking to Western news media. Beijing expelled many American journalists, including those at The New York Times. This single narrative also means that people who donât fit into it risk getting left behind. Ye, the Wuhan volunteer group organizer, doesnât believe that Wuhan could claim a victory over the pandemic. âMy whole world has changed, and it will probably never go back to what it used to be,â she said. Sheâs still struggling with depression and the fear of getting out of her apartment. An outgoing person before the pandemic, she has attended only one social gathering since the end of the lockdown in April. âAll of a sudden we were locked up at home for many days. So many people passed away. But nobody was held accountable,â she said. âI would probably feel better if someone could apologize that they didnât do their job.â âI canât forget the pain,â she said. âItâs engraved in my bones and my heart.â

 BEIJING: Rescuers in east China on Sunday pulled 11 miners from hundreds of metres underground where they had been trapped for two weeks, state media reported, as the race to locate the remaining 10 intensified. The miners were brought to the surface starting from around 11 am Sunday, state broadcaster CCTV reported -- a major breakthrough for a rescue operation that has captivated the nation. One miner was in "extremely weak physical condition" and rushed to hospital, CCTV said. The 11 miners were rescued after the air ventilator shaft was cleared, the official state news agency Xinhua reported, citing the operation's command centre. A further ten remain unaccounted for. Specialist teams have been battling difficult conditions since an explosion at the Hushan mine in Shandong province trapped the miners underground amid rising waters on January 10. The explosion occurred in a ventilator shaft, causing a blockage that damaged the cable car. On Sunday morning the huge obstacles suddenly fell to the bottom of the shaft, allowing the operation to take a big step forward, rescue expert Du Bingjian said. "After the obstacles fell to the bottom of the shaft, the rescue team started to bring up the miners and suspended the drilling work," Du told the Global Times. "It is currently unclear when the rescuers will reach the Sixth Central Section where the missing miners are believed to be." State broadcaster footage on Sunday showed a small elevator carriage lifted to the surface, accompanied by rescue workers. A masked man, who appeared unable to stand, was carried out. Later footage showed emergency workers lifting out other miners, who wore black shades to protect their eyes from the light. One appeared to be holding his hands as if praying. Contact was first established a week ago with a group of 11 miners trapped in a section of the mine around 580 metres (1,900 feet) below the surface. One of them was seriously injured in the initial explosion and died after falling into a coma. Another miner was found alive by rescuers as they attempted to reach the group. Rescue teams have been lowering food, medicine and other supplies to the group through several lifeline shafts drilled into the rock. State media reported Friday that the health of the miners had been gradually returning to a "normal state" after regular deliveries of food. Life detectors and nutrient solutions have been lowered to other parts of the mine in the hope of reaching those still missing. In December, 23 workers died after becoming stuck underground in the southwestern city of Chongqing.

 JERUSALEM: Israel on Sunday said it has opened its embassy in the United Arab Emirates, following through on last year's US-brokered agreement to establish full diplomatic ties with the Gulf country. Israel's Foreign Ministry said the embassy would be in a temporary office while a permanent location is prepared. Eitan Na'eh, a veteran Israeli diplomat, will serve as the head of mission. Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said the opening of the new embassy would allow the broadening of what already are warm ties between Israel and the UAE. Since formally establishing ties in September, the two countries have already established direct flights and exchanged numerous trade delegations, while thousands of Israeli tourists have visited the UAE. The UAE was the first of four Arab countries to establish or renew ties with Israel under a series of agreements brokered by the Trump administration. The Foreign Ministry said Israel would soon open an interest section in Morocco and a consulate in Dubai. It also said an embassy in Bahrain has been operating for several weeks.

 LONDON: The Egyptians who took to the streets on Jan. 25, 2011, knew what they were doing. They knew they risked arrest and worse. But as their numbers swelled in Cairo's central Tahrir Square, they tasted success. Police forces backed off, and within days, former President Hosni Mubarak agreed to demands to step down. But events didn't turn out the way many of the protesters envisioned. A decade later, thousands are estimated to have fled abroad to escape the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi that is considered even more oppressive. The significant loss of academics, artists, journalists and other intellectuals has, along with a climate of fear, hobbled any political opposition. Dr. Mohamed Aboelgheit was among those jailed in the southern city of Assiut in 2011 after joining calls for revolt against police brutality and Mubarak. He spent part of the uprising in a cramped cell. Released amid the chaos, he reveled in the atmosphere of political freedom in the Arab world's most populous country _ protesting, working as a journalist and joining a campaign for a moderate presidential candidate. But it did not last. Interim military rulers followed Mubarak. In 2012, Mohamed Morsi, a member of Egypt's most powerful Islamist group, the Muslim Brotherhood, was elected as the first civilian president in the country's history. But his tenure proved divisive. Amid massive protests, the military - led by then-Defense Minister el-Sissi - removed Morsi in 2013, dissolved parliament and eventually banned the Brotherhood as a ``terrorist group.'' A crackdown on dissent ensued, and el-Sissi won two terms in elections that human rights groups criticized as undemocratic. "I began to feel, by degree, more fear and threats," Aboelgheit said. Friends were jailed, his writings critical of the government drew attention, and ``I wasn't going to wait until it happened to me,'' he added. After el-Sissi came to power, Aboelgheit left for London, where he's published investigative reports on other parts of the Arab world. At his former home in Egypt, national security agents asked about him. When Aboelgheit's wife last returned to visit relatives, she was summoned for questioning about his activities. The message was clear. No one knows exactly how many Egyptians like Aboelgheit have fled political persecution. Data from the World Bank shows an increase in emigres from Egypt since 2011. A total of 3,444,832 left in 2017 - nearly 60,000 more than in 2013, the years for which figures are available. But it's impossible to tell economic migrants from political exiles. They relocated to Berlin, Paris and London. Egyptians also have settled in Turkey, Qatar, Sudan and even Asian countries like Malaysia and South Korea. Human Rights Watch estimated in 2019 that there were 60,000 political prisoners in Egypt. The Committee to Protect Journalists ranks Egypt third, behind China and Turkey, in detaining journalists. El-Sissi maintains Egypt has no political prisoners. The arrest of a journalist or a rights worker makes news roughly every month. Many people have been imprisoned on terrorism charges, for breaking a ban on protests or for disseminating false news. Others remain in indefinite pretrial detentions. El-Sissi maintains Egypt is holding back Islamic extremism so it doesn't descend into chaos like its neighbors. ``Sissi wants not only to abrogate the rights of the opposition and to prevent any critical voice from being uttered, Sissi doesn't actually believe, not only in the opposition, but he doesn't believe in politics,`` said Khaled Fahmy, an Egyptian professor of modern Middle Eastern History at Cambridge UniversityFahmy believes this is the worst period in Egypt's modern history for personal rights. ``It's much more serious, it's much deeper and much darker, what Sissi has in mind,'' he said. Those abroad who could challenge el-Sissi have chosen to not return. Taqadum al-Khatib, an academic who also worked in the nascent political scene after 2011, was researching Egypt's former Jewish community in Germany when he learned that returning to his homeland was no longer an option. The Egyptian cultural attache in Berlin summoned al-Khatib for a meeting, and an official questioned him about his articles, social media posts and research. He was asked to hand over his passport but refused. Shortly thereafter, he was fired from his job at an Egyptian university. He feels lucky to be able to work toward his doctorate in Germany but misses Cairo's bustle. ``It's a very difficult situation. I couldn't go back to my home,'' al-Khatib said. Fahmy said he's seen outspoken expatriates have their Egyptian citizenship revoked. A government press officer did not respond to a request for comment on targeting and intimidating Egyptians - either abroad or at home - based on their work as journalists, activists or academics, or for expressing political opinions. Journalist Asma Khatib, 29, remembers the heady days of 2011, when young people thought they could bring change. A reporter for a pro-Muslim Brotherhood news agency, Khatib covered Morsi's short presidency amid criticism the group was using violence against opponents and seeking to monopolize power to make Egypt an Islamic state. After Morsi's ouster, his supporters held sit-ins for his reinstatement at a square in Cairo. A month later, the new military leaders forcibly cleared them out, and more than 600 people were killed. Khatib documented the violence. Soon, colleagues started being arrested, and she fled Egypt - first to Malaysia, then to Indonesia and Turkey. She was tried in absentia on espionage charges in 2015, convicted and sentenced to death. Now, she and her husband Ahmed Saad, also a journalist, and their two children are seeking asylum in South Korea. They expect they'll never return, but also realize they're lucky to be free. On the day the ruling was announced, the journalist remembers telling herself: ``You don't have a country anymore.'' ``I know that there are lots of others like me. I'm not any different from those who are in prison,'' she said. The exiles have had ample time to think about where Egypt's uprising failed. The broad alliance of protesters -_ from Islamists to secular activists - fractured without a common enemy like Mubarak, and the most extreme voices became the loudest. The role of religion in society remained largely unanswered, and liberal secular initiatives never gained traction. No one accounted for how many people would embrace former regime figures, especially in a crisis. Most Egyptians abroad have not been politically active, fearing for family and friends back home. But some have continued on the path begun on Jan. 25, 2011. Tamim Heikal, working in the corporate world when the protests erupted, had doubted the government could ever reform. But he soon became a communications manager for an emerging political party. Later, he watched others being locked up, and knew his turn had come when he got an invitation from intelligence officers in 2017 to ``come have coffee.'' He booked a ticket to Paris and hasn't gone back. Now, at age 42, he wants to educate himself and others for when a popular movement re-emerges in Egypt. He makes ends meet by editing, translating and doing consulting work for rights groups, and tries to network among the diaspora. ``It's as if I was infected with a virus, after the revolution,'' he said. ``I don't know how to go back. I won't be able to relax until change happens.'' Others try to cope in strange lands. Asma Khatib and her husband aren't sure what to say to their young children when they ask where they're from. Abouelgheit, the doctor-turned-journalist, worries his son won't speak Arabic after so much time in the United Kingdom. He hopes to go home one day, but in the meantime, he's considering returning to the medical profession.

 TEHRAN: Iran's supreme leader's office has posted a photomontage of former US president Donald Trump playing golf under the shadow of a warplane alongside a pledge to avenge a deadly 2020 drone strike he ordered. The post on Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's @khamenei_site Twitter account late Thursday warned there was no escape from payback for the US strike outside Baghdad airport which killed Iran's storied foreign operations chief General Qasem Soleimani and his Iraqi lieutenant. "Revenge is inevitable. Soleimani's killer and the man who gave the orders must face vengeance," it said. "Revenge can take place at any moment." Trump left office on Wednesday and flew straight to his Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida, without attending the inauguration of his successor President Joe Biden. Iranian officials have pledged repeatedly that Soleimani will be avenged. Earlier this month, on the first anniversary of his killing, judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi warned that not even Trump was "immune from justice" and that Soleimani's killers would "not be safe anywhere in the world".

 RIYADH: When Chinese diplomat Tan Banglin defended his countryâs treatment of Muslims amid an international outcry, his comments were less remarkable than where he made them. In a column last July for one of the most widely read newspapers in Saudi Arabiaâthe traditional protector of Muslims worldwideâTan talked about how the Communist Party had united with people in Xinjiang province, leading to âgreatâ changes. Thatâs as nations including the US were accusing China of putting Uighurs into detention camps. The voice given to Chinaâs consul general in Jeddah, less than 70 kilometers from Islamâs holiest city of Mecca, reflects the new political reckoning under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as he prioritizes more secular national interests at a critical juncture for the kingdom. And itâs one that may serve him well as the administration changes in Washington, despite US opposition to Beijingâs actions in Xinjiang. The Saudi world view is being shaped more by hard-nosed business calculations, shifting geopolitical realities and the emergence of clean energy as a competitor to oil while facing a challenge from Turkey for leadership of the Sunni Muslim sphere. The kingdom has been less vocal on the Palestinian issue, which for decades was its cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre. Saudi support for the Muslim population has been conspicuous by its absence in Kashmir, with the Pakistan government turning to Turkey while Prince Mohammed increases trade with India. âSaudi Arabia suffered from transnational political Islamism where some of its citizens were among the first to travel to help fellow Muslims, but not much identify with their own national causes,â said Prince Abdullah bin Khaled, a Saudi academic. âA change of course was required and very much welcomed.â US President Joe Biden has vowed to treat Saudi Arabia as a pariah after four years of cozy relations with his predecessor, Donald Trump. Conversations on issues on human rights, its devastating war on Yemen and rivalry with Iran are likely to be uncomfortable when they eventually happen. There could also be more tension over the 2018 killing of critic and columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul after Bidenâs nominee for national intelligence director this week pledged to release a report on who was responsible for the murder. But retrenching from intervening abroad under the guise of supporting fellow Muslimsâlike Turkey is doingâmay score some points with the Biden administration, according to Emily Hawthorne, a Texas-based analyst with Stratfor, which advises clients on geopolitical risks. âSaudis might see that becoming more of an economically focused modernized nation as more important than continuing to always nurture that leadership role in the broader Muslim world,â said Hawthorne. âItâs a gamble, but it might turn out well for them in terms of earning Saudi Arabia some clout.â Until a few years ago, it would have been rare to see warm praise for a communist party in print in Saudi Arabia, not to mention one from the representative of a country thatâs been censured for its alleged persecution of Muslims. In the 1980s Saudis sent money, and later their sons, to Afghanistan to join the fight against Soviet occupation of that country. Saudi relations with China have strengthened beyond supplying oil. King Salman, who took the throne in 2015, and the crown prince have paid separate visits to Beijing. On his trip in 2019, the prince appeared to defend Chinaâs alleged repression of Muslims and signed a deal to build a $10 billion refining and petrochemicals complex. This month, Chinaâs Huawei launched its largest flagship store outside China in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Investment Minister Khalid AlFalih tweeted the news, saying he was âdelightedâ with the announcement. Itâs been a journey that started slowly after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks by 19 hijackers, 15 of them Saudi, and accelerated under Prince Mohammed. Under pressure to curb extremists, Saudi Arabia waged a successful campaign against radicals in the 2000s. Significantly, the late King Abdullah made Saudi National Day on September 23 a holiday, angering radicals who believe Muslims should not be divided by borders. As he rose to power four years ago, Prince Mohammed curbed the influence of the powerful religious establishment, gave women more freedoms and allowed concerts and movie theaters. He also tightened control of how financial aid is distributed abroad, making it largely to governments rather than directly to Muslim groups. Alcohol, which the Koran forbids, remains banned. The change was not an abandonment of Muslim issues but rather âbalancing support for them with the imperatives, sensitivities and priorities of the state, knowing that different contexts dictate different realities,â said Prince Abdullah, the academic. Indeed, Saudi Arabia used to be the first country to be blamed for fueling Islamist terrorism. Yet following a series of gruesome attacks by jihadists in France last year, it was Turkey that French President Emmanuel Macron singled out as an instigator. Saudi Arabia will always have the physical claim to Islam. Prince Mohammed, through his actions and decisions, has made it clear that the kingdomâs duty is to care for the two holy mosques in Mecca and Madinah and make them accessible to Muslims worldwide. One of the goals of his plan to restructure the economy is expanding the two sites and increasing the number of pilgrims. At the same time, the leadership has signaled itâs not the kingdomâs duty to fix the problems of Muslims worldwide. When India revoked Article 370 granting special status to Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan, which also claims the region, had hoped that Saudi Arabia would galvanize Muslims around this issue. The kingdom, the biggest source of remittances into Pakistan and among its largest creditors, didnât. Instead, trade with India, which the kingdom sees as an important economic powerhouse, has thrived since then as Saudi Arabia seeks to deepen its foothold in that country. In the third quarter of 2020, India, along with Egypt, drove an increase in foreign investment in the kingdom, a key pillar of the crown princeâs economic diversification plan. In the meantime, Turkey has been boosting ties with Islamabad. Its foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, opened a new consulate in Pakistan this month, promised to send investors to explore opportunities and presided over the signing of agreements in the movie industry. Turkish-Pakistani relations are âunique and enviableâ Mujahid Anwar Khan, Pakistanâs chief of air staff, told Turkeyâs state-run Andalou Agency this month. He thanked the Turkish leadership for its âsupportive statementsâ on Kashmir. The Saudis may be losing the soft-power game to Turkey at the moment, said Hawthorne. âBut theyâre probably valuing other games.â âTurkey has economic limits as to how much it is willing to sacrifice its own economic interests in pursuit of gaining the soft power. This is never a zero sum game.â

 MOSCOW: The Kremlin on Sunday accused the US embassy of interfering in Russia's domestic affairs after the mission distributed a "demonstration alert" to US citizens in Russia recommending they avoid protests. Nearly 3,500 protesters were arrested at demonstrations in support of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on Saturday, a monitor reported, as Russian authorities probed violence on the part of both protesters and police.  Police clashed with demonstrators in Moscow as tens of thousands took to the streets across the country on Saturday following Navalny's call to demonstrate against President Vladimir Putin's 20-year rule.  Ahead of the demonstrations, the US embassy issued a safety warning to Americans based in Russia.  "Of course, these publications are inappropriate," President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a state TV channel.  "And of course indirectly, they are absolutely an interference in our domestic affairs," he added.  He accused the US embassy of "indirectly" supporting the violation of Russian legislation and backing "unauthorised protests".  He said that if the Russian embassy in the United Sates issued similar information "this would cause a certain feeling of discomfort in Washington".  The Russian foreign ministry on Saturday said the representatives of the US embassy would be summoned and would have to "explain themselves".  A US mission spokeswoman earlier Sunday said US embassies and consulates around the world routinely issue safety messages to US citizens.  "This is a common, routine practice of many countries' diplomatic missions," she told AFP.  On Saturday, the US embassy in Moscow also said it was following the rallies, adding that Washington supported "the right of all people to peaceful protest, freedom of expression".  "Steps being taken by Russian authorities are suppressing those rights," embassy spokeswoman Rebecca Ross said on Twitter.

 WASHINGTON/LONDON: Joe Biden conveyed his intention to strengthen the "special relationship" with the UK in his first call as the US President with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, during which the two leaders re-committed to the NATO alliance and agreed to cooperate on combating climate change and containing the Covid-19 pandemic. The conversation with Johnson over phone on Saturday was Biden's third involving a foreign leader since his inauguration on Wednesday, after he spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Friday. "Great to speak to President Joe Biden this evening. I look forward to deepening the longstanding alliance between our two countries as we drive a green and sustainable recovery from Covid-19," Johnson said in a tweet. It seem that a new trade agreement was not on the list of priorities for both sides. While the Downing Street readout of the phone call referred to Johnson reiterating his intention to resolve existing trade issues as soon as possible, the White House communique of the call only referred to "strengthening the special relationship". "The president conveyed his intention to strengthen the special relationship between our countries and revitalise transatlantic ties, underscoring the critical role of NATO to our collective defense and shared values," the White House said. "Building on the UK and US' long history of cooperation in security and defence, the leaders re-committed to the NATO alliance and our shared values in promoting human rights and protecting democracy. They also discussed the benefits of a potential free trade deal between our two countries, and the Prime Minister reiterated his intention to resolve existing trade issues as soon as possible," a Downing Street spokesperson said. The UK is keen to conclude a post-Brexit free trade agreement with the US, but the new American administration has been less vocal over this amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic crisis. The global health crisis and vaccination programme in both countries and around the world as well as climate change were areas of more mutual agreement, with security and defence through strengthening the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) also high on the agenda â in contrast with former President Donald Trump's hard ball with the alliance. During the call, President Biden noted the importance of cooperation, including through multilateral organisations, on shared challenges such as combatting climate change, containing Covid-19, and ensuring global health security, the White House said. The leaders also discussed the need for coordination on shared foreign policy priorities, including China, Iran, and Russia, it said. "The Prime Minister warmly welcomed the President's decision to re-join the Paris Agreement on climate change, as well as the World Health Organisation and the COVAX programme to ensure equitable access for vaccines,â the Downing Street spokesperson said. On climate change, Johnson is said to have also praised President Biden's early action on tackling climate change and commitment to reach Net Zero by 2050. "The leaders looked forward to meeting in person as soon as the circumstances allow, and to working together through the G7, G20 and COP26 this year,â the spokesperson added. The UK will be hosting the G7 summit in Cornwall in June, which is expected to be Biden's first visit to the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also due to join the summit for its guest country sessions. The new White House incumbent is famously anti-Brexit but all early indications are that his views on the UK's exit from the European Union (EU) are unlikely to overshadow US-UK relations in future. In his call with Mexico's President, Biden and Obrador agreed to work closely to stem the flow of irregular migration to Mexico and the US, as well as to promote development in the Northern Triangle of Central America. "The president outlined his plan to reduce migration by addressing its root causes, increasing resettlement capacity and lawful alternative immigration pathways, improving processing at the border to adjudicate requests for asylum, and reversing the previous administration's draconian immigration policies,â the White House said. They also recognised the importance of coordination to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, it said.

 LONDON: One of England's leading medical officers on Sunday urged the public to continue to follow the strict lockdown rules because any vaccine-related immunity from Covid-19 takes at least three weeks to kick in. Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer, also warned that there is no clear evidence yet to show that vaccinated people cannot transmit the deadly virus on to others. âRegardless of whether someone has had their vaccination or not, it is vital that everyone follows the national restrictions and public health advice, as protection takes up to three weeks to kick in and we don't yet know the impact of vaccines on transmission,â said Van-Tam. His warning comes as the UK registered another high daily death toll from the virus of 1,348 this weekend, taking the country's total to 97,329. However, he pointed to an additional 32 vaccination sites coming on stream to add to the thousands of venues where the National Health Service (NHS) has been delivering 140 jabs a minute, taking the vaccinated total to over 5.8 million. âThe vaccine is rightly something to celebrate â let's stay patient, stay at home and support the NHS as it continues to roll out the vaccine,â he said. A Living Museum where the BBC filmed a hit drama series âPeaky Blinders' based on the notorious Birmingham gang in the 1920s is among the new vaccine sites. A former IKEA store at the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, London, the Francis Crick Institute, which is also in the UK capital, the Nightingale Hospital in Sunderland and the Blackpool Winter Gardens will also be new vaccination centres. The latest openings mean there will be a network of almost 50 across the country, adding to options alongside hospitals, pharmacies and general practice (GP) surgeries. âThrough the vaccines delivery plan, we have made outstanding progress in vaccinating our NHS and care staff and the most vulnerable people in society,â said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock. âWe must not drop our guard. While the vaccine can prevent severe disease, we do not know if it stops you from passing on the virus to others, and it takes time to develop immunity after a jab, so for now everyone must continue to stay at home to help bring down infections and protect the NHS,â he said. The NHS said the new vaccine centres will each be capable of delivering thousands of jabs each week, scaling up and down according to vaccine supplies and demand. People eligible in the priority criteria of over-80s, followed by over-70s, care home workers and staff as well as frontline workers, are being invited when it is their turn and people are being urged not to just turn up. âThese new centres provide another option for people invited for their jabs, alongside the fantastic work of local GPs,â said Professor Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director. Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi added: âAs of next week there will be almost 50 vaccination centres, more than 250 hospitals hubs and over 1,000 local vaccination service sites, run by GPs and pharmacies right across the country. âThis will enable us to vaccinate as many people as possible in the weeks and months to come and I encourage anyone who has been invited for a free vaccine to come forward and get a jab.â The NHS said its new Vaccination Centres will kick off by jabbing mainly health and social care staff from Monday before opening their doors to more patients on Tuesday.

 $1B Mega Millions prize a result of long odds, slow sales

 DES MOINES: The jackpot for the Mega Millions lottery game has grown to $1 billion ahead of Friday night's drawing after more than four months without a winner thanks to bad luck, poor odds and reduced play partially blamed on the coronavirus pandemic. It's only the third time a lottery jackpot has grown so large, but much has changed since the last time such a big prize was up for grabs in 2018. The odds of winning a jackpot remain the same _ incredibly small _ but for a variety of reasons fewer people are playing Mega Millions or Powerball, the two lottery games offered in most of the country. And even as the huge Mega Millions prize and a $731.1 million Powerball jackpot won Wednesday by a single ticket sold in Maryland have juiced sales for the games, Maryland lottery director Gordon Medenica noted: ``We're not out of the woods yet.'' Medenica acknowledged sales were dramatically lower before the pandemic, and they tanked even further in the spring and summer. After a peak in October 2018, Medenica said sales of the big lottery games dropped about 50%, prompting talk among lottery officials about jackpot fatigue. Sales of Mega Millions and Powerball continued to decline after the virus hit along with other lottery games, but while scratch tickets and other instant games rebounded strongly later in the year, national game sales remained moribund. In response to falling sales, officials updated the national games to reduce starting jackpots from $40 million to $20 million and changed rules about guaranteed minimum increases between drawings. The moves made fiscal sense but they caused jackpots to grow more slowly, further tamping down sales, as demonstrated by the record 37 draws without a winner it took to reach the current Mega Millions jackpot that's still far less than the all-time highs. ``That's why it takes so many rolls to get up to a high jackpot level,'' Medenica said. What hasn't changed are the odds. By design, Mega Millions and Powerball are relatively generous in awarding small dollar prizes and lottery officials boast there is a roughly one in 24 chance of winning something. But to generate huge jackpots, officials must be absolutely miserly about paying jackpots. It's hard to fathom how unlikely it is to beat odds of one in 292.2 million for Powerball or one in 302.5 million for Mega Millions. To get a sense of your chances, Steven Bleiler, a mathematics and statistics professor at Portland State University, said people should imagine a swimming pool 40 feet (12.2 meters) wide, 120 feet (36.6 meters) long and 5 feet (1.5 meters) deep, filled to the brim with M&Ms, only one of which is green. To win, all a player must do is jump in blindfolded and wade around until finding that single green candy. Andrew Swift, a mathematics professor at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, put it this way: Your chances of picking up two oysters and finding a pearl in both is about twice as likely as winning either lottery jackpot. Still, someone always ultimately wins, and it happened again after Wednesday night's Powerball drawing when a single ticket sold at a convenience store in the small community of Lonaconing, Maryland, hit all six numbers. The winner can take a $716.3 annuity paid over 30 years or a cash prize of $546.8 million. What comes next is unclear. Some states are banking on growth in online games, but while the 10 states that allow purchases on computers and phone apps are seeing rising sales, such purchases remain a relatively small percentage of overall revenue. ``The current roll has revived the game as it's been designed,'' Medenica said. ``Whether we continue to consider making changes or not is to be seen.''

 A law to crow about: France upholds rural 'sensory heritage'

 PARIS: From crowing roosters to the whiff of barnyard animals, the "sensory heritage" of France's countryside will now be protected by law from attempts to stifle the everyday aspects of rural life from newcomers looking for peace and quiet. French senators on Thursday gave final approval to a law proposed in the wake of several high-profile conflicts by village residents and vacationers, or recent arrivals derided as "neo-rurals". A rowdy rooster named Maurice in particular made headlines in 2019 after a court in western France rejected a bid to have him silenced by neighbours who had purchased a holiday home nearby. "Living in the countryside implies accepting some nuisances," Joel Giraud, the government's minister in charge of rural life, told lawmakers. Cow bells (and cow droppings), grasshopper chirps and noisy early-morning tractors are also now considered part of France's natural heritage that will be codified in its environmental legislation. "It sends a strong message," said Pierre-Antoine Levi, the senator who acted as rapporteur for the bill. "It can act as a useful tool for local officials as they carry out their educational and mediation duties," he said. The law is emblematic of growing tensions in the countryside between longtime residents and outsiders whose bucolic expectations often clash with everyday realities. Corinne Fesseau and her rooster Maurice became the image of the fight when she was brought to court by pensioners next door over the animal's shrill wake-up calls. Critics saw the lawsuit as part of a broader threat to France's hallowed rural heritage by outsiders and city dwellers unable or unwilling to understand the realities of country life. Thousands of people signed a "Save Maurice" petition, and a judge eventually upheld the cock-a-doodle-doos. In another case from 2019, a woman in the duck-breeding heartland of the Landes region was brought to court by a newcomer neighbour fed up with the babbling of the ducks and geese in her back garden. A court in southwest France also threw out that case.

 PARIS: Frenchwoman Jeanne Pouchain has an unusual problem. Sheâs officially dead. She has been trying for three years to prove that she is alive. The 58-year-old woman says she lives in constant fear, not daring to leave her house in the village of Saint Joseph, in the Loire region. Authorities seized her car over an unpaid debt she contests and which is at the center of her troubles. She fears the family furniture will be next. Pouchainâs status has prevented her and her husband, who is her legal beneficiary along with her son, from using their joint bank account. Being declared deceased has deprived her of other critical amenities. Pouchainâs status as deceased is the result of a 2017 Lyon court decision that deemed her dead even though no death certificate was produced. The decision came at the end of a legal dispute with an employee of Pouchainâs former cleaning company, who was seeking compensation after losing her job 20 years ago. According to Pouchain and her attorney, snowballing judicial errors ended with the 2017 ruling by the Appeals Court of Lyon that Pouchain was not among the living. The legal imbroglio is all the stranger because, Pouchain contended, neither she nor her relatives got summons for the hearing. Cormier, her attorney, filed an unusual motion last Monday to invalidate the 2017 decision by the Lyon appeals court due to a âgrave errorâ by the judges. He said he has never before dealt with such a âcrazyâ case.

 FAIR HAVEN: A goat and a dog who were each elected mayor have helped raise money to renovate a Vermont community playground. The oddball idea of pet mayor elections to raise money to rehabilitate the playground and to help get local kids civically involved came from a local town manager. In 2018, Fair Haven residents elected Lincoln the goat as its honorary mayor. Lincoln helped raise about $10,000 while the current mayor, Murfee, a Cavalier King Charles spaniel, has raised $20,000, Town Manager Joe Gunter told the Rutland Herald. The town chipped in another $20,000. Murfee's owner, Linda Barker, said that when she was talked into having Murfee get involved in politics, she thought it would be easy to raise money through T-shirts. Then the pandemic struck. So she shifted to masks. She's made nearly 1,000 of them, and will be making another round of them for Valentine's Day. She raised more than $5,000 from the masks and a similar amount from basket raffles. The town was also recently awarded a $50,000 grant from the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, she said. Ironically, the honorary mayor is not welcome on the playground. Barker said there's a "no dogs allowed" sign. âMurfee is going to take that up with the town,â Barker said Sunday with a chuckle. âHe's going to contest that.â

 WASHINGTON: An Indian national has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and identity theft in connection with an overseas robocall scam that defrauded thousands in the US, mostly elderly people, of nearly $8 million, the Department of Justice said. Shehzadkhan Pathan, 39, operated a call centre in Gujarat's Ahmedabad that placed automated robocalls to victims in the United States, as per court documents. After establishing contact with the victims through these automated calls, Pathan and other "closers" at his call centre would coerce, cajole, and trick victims to send bulk cash through physical shipments and electronic money transfers, federal prosecutors alleged. Pathan and his conspirators used a variety of schemes to convince victims to send money, including impersonating law enforcement officers from the FBI and DEA and representatives of other government agencies such as the Social Security Administration, to threaten victims with severe legal and financial consequences. Conspirators also convinced the victims to send money as initial installments for falsely promised loans, the court documents said. According to the court papers, Pathan also recruited and supervised several money mules, who he directed to receive money sent by the victims. His network of money mules was located in multiple states, including but not limited to Virginia, New Jersey, Minnesota, Texas, California, South Carolina, and Illinois. Pathan assigned various aliases to these individuals and supplied them with hundreds of counterfeit identification documents to facilitate their receipt of cash shipments and money transfers. He then directed the money mules to send the money to himself and other conspirators through various means, including cash deposits into numerous bank accounts and via informal money transmitters known as hawalas, the prosecutors alleged. The Department of Justice said Pathan's scams disproportionately targeted elderly victims, many of whom suffered substantial financial hardship. In total, Pathan is responsible for defrauding over 5,000 US victims of at least $8 million, it added. His sentencing is scheduled for May 14. Pathan faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for the conspiracy, along with a mandatory consecutive term of two years for aggravated identity theft.

Farmworkers are the backbone of both our nations and must have their voices heard. I hope there's a peaceful and fair solution so they can provide for their families,â Khanna said in a tweet on Saturday. âI am encouraged by the ongoing dialogue,â he said, joining other American lawmakers who have expressed their views on the ongoing farmers' protest in India, several of whom have expressed their concerns. âAs Co-Chair of the American Sikh Caucus in Congress, my office has received first-hand accounts of the horrific crackdowns on protestors who are trying to peacefully express their disapproval of India's recent agricultural reform legislation,â said Congressman John Garamendi, who along with two other lawmakers wrote a letter to India's Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu early this week. According to the letter, âhundreds of thousands of farmers from the states of Punjab and Haryana that have made their way to New Delhi to peacefully protest these new agricultural laws, and the Indian government has met these peaceful protestors with tear gas, water cannons, barricades, baton attacks, and more. âMany of these farmers have children, relatives, and friends who are US citizens, many of whom have reached out to us to share their concerns about these developments. We urge the Indian government to demonstrate its respect for these crucial democratic freedoms, and to be a model of democratic values in the vital Indo-Pacific regionâ. The letter, dated December 4, was released this week. The two other lawmakers who have expressed their concern on the protest were congressman Jim Costa and congresswoman Shelia Jackson Lee, members of the American Sikh Caucus. Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. There have been multiple rounds of talks between representatives of the protestors and the government but the logjam continues.

 Indian-American in Time's 'Heroes of 2020' for giving shelter to 70 George Floyd protesters

 NEW YORK: Indian-American Rahul Dubey, who had opened the doors of his Washington DC home to over 70 people demonstrating against the killing of George Floyd, has been hailed among the "Heroes of 2020" by the TIME magazine, honouring those who "went above and beyond the call of duty" this year.  In the 'Heroes of 2020', the publication also named Australia's volunteer firefighters who risked everything to keep their country safe, food-stall owners Jason Chua and Hung Zhen Long in Singapore who wouldn't let anyone go hungry during the Covid-19 pandemic, Pastor Reshorna Fitzpatrick and her husband Bishop Derrick Fitzpatrick of Chicago, who transformed their church to support their community during the trying year.  A newspaper deliveryman Greg Dailey, who began a grocery drop-off service in mid-March to anyone in need along his paper route and has since supplied more than 140 homes and conducted over 1,000 grocery runs in New Jersey's Mercer county, was also named by the magazine.  "From citizens providing food and shelter to those in need to volunteers who protected their neighbours from natural disasters, these heroes went above and beyond the call of duty in 2020," TIME said.  TIME described Dubey as "The Man Who Gave Shelter to Those in Need."  On June 1, as demonstrators filled the streets of Washington DC to protest the killing of African-American Floyd, Dubey was home, not far from the White House.  After a 7 PM curfew, he noticed crowds in the street outside as "police had set up barricades seemingly to trap protesters, and were pepper-spraying those who remained. Dubey decided to take action," TIME said.  "I open my door, and I start yelling, 'Get in!'" says Dubey, who works in the health care sector. "All these people were swarming in."  Dubey said he gave about 70 protesters refuge in his home, housing them overnight to avoid curfew breaches.  "People were coughing, crying, strangers pouring milk into strangers' eyes," Dubey said.  "They were sharing information, writing down numbers for bail bondsmen. It was this real camaraderie."  A report in TIME said Dubey claims police officers made several attempts to breach his sanctuary that evening: posing as protesters trying to get inside, and attempting to intercept the pizza delivery he had ordered for his houseguests.  The move to open his door was driven by instinct, Dubey says nearly six months later. "It's what was needed."  For his act, Dubey had been hailed as a hero and saviour as those who took shelter in his house started tweeting about it.  "Rahul saved lives last night," one Black Lives Matter activist had written on Twitter.  "He ended this with an inspirational speech about not giving up and keeping up the peaceful fight. What a guy. Thank you, Rahul."  Dubey had told BuzzFeed News that it wasn't a choice to open his door and provide refuge to the mostly young protesters.  "If you had seen what was going on in front of my eyes, there was no choice. People were getting pepper-sprayed and beaten and slammed to the ground," he had told the media outlet.  "I hope that my 13-year-old son grows up to be just as amazing as they are," Dubey was quoted as saying by WJLA news.  Floyd, 46, died in Minneapolis on May 25 when a white police officer pinned him to the ground and knelt on his neck as he gasped for breath.  The footage, which went viral, showed Floyd pleading with the officer, saying he can't breathe. The four police officers seen in the footage have since been charged.  His death triggered nationwide violent protests with a section of the protesters resorting to looting and rioting across the country, leaving behind a trail of destruction.

 WASHINGTON: Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal has been elected as the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), making her one of the most powerful US lawmakers in the 117th Congress. Jayapal, 55, who was elected on Wednesday, said that the caucus is going to advance racial justice, tackle poverty and inequality and help transform the country. "As a lifelong organiser, I am honoured that my colleagues have elected me to lead the Congressional Progressive Caucus at this pivotal moment," Jayapal said soon after her election to this most powerful Congressional Caucus, which is slated to play an influential role during the next Biden Administration. Joe Biden, 78, is due to take over as the 46th president of the US on January 20. "We have massive crises knocking at our nation's door, and the work of the Progressive Caucus has never been more important. The American people need Congress to lead with vision, conviction, empathy, and dedication to people and families in every community who are struggling right now," said Jayapal. The incoming Executive Board of CPC is made up of 26 members - one Chair, one Deputy Chair, one Whip, two Chair Emeriti, two Special Order Hour Conveners, ten Vice Chairs, one Executive Board Member At-Large and eight Deputy Whips. The CPC Executive Board is representative of the diversity within the caucus - more than half of Executive Board members are people of colour and more than half are women. Incoming CPC Deputy Chair Congresswoman Katie Porter said that in 2018, many of her Democratic colleagues and she successfully ran campaigns rooted in progressive values. "Rather than shying away from our core principles, we embraced them- making it clear that a progressive agenda is not only the right policy for America, but also a winning political message," she said. CPC Whip Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said, "we have a unique opportunity to fight for transformative change in the 117th Congress- whether that is addressing the coronavirus pandemic, passing universal healthcare, tackling the climate crisis or reorienting our foreign policy." "I look forward to continuing to represent my colleagues in building an effect progressive voting bloc in Congress alongside fearless leaders like Reps. Pramila Jayapal and Katie," she said. Among others, Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna has been elected as Deputy Whip, while Congresswoman Rashida Talib as vice chair for member services. "We have massive crises knocking at our nation's door and our work has never been more important. It's time for Congress to act boldly and restore power to where it belongs: with the people," Jayapal said in a tweet. "Together, our caucus is going to deliver real relief to families, advance racial justice, tackle poverty and inequality, champion climate justice, and help transform this country so working people can finally get ahead. Let's get to work," Jayapal said.

 LONDON: An 87-year-old man and his 83-year-old wife from the north east of England on Tuesday became the first Indian-origin couple in the world to get a vaccine against Covid-19, after they got injected with their first of two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab at a hospital in Newcastle. Dr Hari Shukla, a race relations campaigner based in Tyne and Wear, had been contacted by the National Health Service (NHS) based on the criteria set for the world's first vaccine to receive regulatory approvals in the UK last week. His wife, Ranjan, then volunteered for the jab as she also falls within the first phase of people aged 80 and over, care home workers as well as NHS workers at high risk eligible to receive the "life-saving jab". "Hari Shukla and his wife Ranjan have become the first two patients at Newcastle Hospitals â and two of the first people in the world â to receive the Covid-19 vaccine," Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said. They join 90-year-old Margaret "Maggie" Keenan from Coventry as the very first in the world to receive her shot, followed by 81-year-old William Shakespeare in Warwickshire as the second. "I'm so pleased we are hopefully coming towards the end of this pandemic and I am delighted to be doing my bit by having the vaccine, I feel it is my duty to do so and do whatever I can to help," said Shukla, who was born in Kenya and whose father hailed from Mumbai. "Having been in contact with the NHS [National Health Service], I know how hard they all work and the greatest respect for them â they have a heart of gold and I am grateful for everything they have done to keep us safe during the pandemic," he said. Shukla, who has been honoured with an MBE, OBE and CBE for his work as the Director of the Tyne and Wear Race Equality Council over the years, was notified by the NHS based on the criteria set by the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation as part of a phased rollout plan based on those at the highest risk of death from the deadly virus. "Today marks a huge step forward in the UK's fight against coronavirus, as we begin delivering the vaccine to the first patients across the whole country. I am immensely proud of the scientists who developed the vaccine, members of the public who took part in trials, and the NHS who have worked tirelessly to prepare for rollout,â said British Prime Minister Prime Johnson. However, he struck a note of caution to warn that mass vaccination will take time and urged the public to remain "clear-eyed" and continue to follow the lockdown rules over the winter months ahead. The NHS said it is undertaking the biggest and most highly anticipated immunisation campaign in history at 50 hospital hubs, with more starting vaccinations over the coming weeks and months as the programme ramps up after the first set of doses arrived from Pfizer's manufacturing site in Belgium. "We will look back on today, V-day, as a key moment in our fight back against this terrible disease, and I am proud our health services across the United Kingdom are about to embark on our largest ever vaccination programme,â said Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who got teary eyed during television interviews on Tuesday as he declared he felt "proud to be British". Since the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine got the green light from the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) last week, the NHS said its workers have been working around the clock to manage the large-scale logistical challenge of deploying the vaccine. "Coronavirus is the greatest health challenge in NHS history, taking loved ones from us and disrupting every part of our lives," said Sir Simon Stevens, NHS Chief Executive. "The deployment of this vaccine marks a decisive turning point in the battle with the pandemic. NHS vaccination programmes which have successfully helped overcome tuberculosis, polio, and smallpox, now turn their focus to coronavirus. NHS staff are proud to be leading the way as the first health service in the world to begin vaccination with this Covid jab," he said. The MHRA has stressed that the vaccine has been cleared for mass rollout only after "rigorous" safety tests despite the process being speeded up due to the urgency of finding an effective vaccine against a pandemic which has wreaked havoc around the world. NHS national medical director, Professor Stephen Powis, has warned that the roll out of a vaccine will be a "marathon" not a sprint. The Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at -70C before being thawed out and can only be moved four times within that cold chain before being used. General Practitioners (GPs) and other primary care staff have also been put on standby to start delivering the jab on a phased basis. Vaccination centres treating large numbers of patients in sporting venues and conference centres will subsequently start up when further supplies of vaccine come on stream, with a bulk of the rollout expected in the early part of the New Year.

 LONDON: UK PM Boris Johnson on Friday backed Priti Patel, one of his most senior ministers, after a damning inquiry into allegations that she bullied her staff concluded she had broken rules, including shouting and swearing at them. Johnson's defence of the Indian-origin home secretary prompted the author of the report, independent adviser Alex Allan, to resign. Patel had not met the standards set under Britain's ministerial code which states ministers should treat officials with respect, Allan had concluded. Ministers usually step down if they are found to be in breach of the code. However, a government statement said Johnson judged the code had not been breached, saying that concerns had not been raised at the time and that Patel was unaware of the impact of her actions. "The PM has full confidence in home secretary and considers this matter now closed," it said. Patel had been accused of demeaning her staff, prompting Johnson to launch an inquiry in March to establish the facts. In a summary of his advice, Allan found that Patel had become "justifiably in many instances" frustrated by her department's lack of support, and this had "manifested itself in forceful expression, including some occasions of shouting and swearing". "Her approach on occasions has amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying...," Allan's advice said. Patel thanked PM for his support and said, "I am sorry that my behaviour in the past has upset people. I acknowledge that I have at times got frustrated." Colleagues rallied round her, describing her as kind. However, Keir Starmer, the leader of Labour Party, said he would have sacked her. Patel had to quit as aid minister in 2017 because she held undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials.

 Donald Trump has left America more divided than ever: Sikh leader

 WASHINGTON: Outgoing President Donald Trump has left America more divided than ever and the country's reputation under his presidency has been damaged on the international stage which will take years to repair, says an influential Indian-American Sikh leader. âThis is a democracy at work, on both sides. Whether Democrat or Republicanâ¦ people are excited and want to speak out. The election's historic turnout means people are hungry to change the status quo on both sides. âWe are more polarised and divided than I have ever seen being an American for 25 years. I believe people do care who will represent them, especially in times like the Covid-19 pandemic,â Indiana-based Gurinder Singh Khalsa told PTI. A recipient of the prestigious Rosa Parks Trailblazer Award in recognition of his efforts in changing the Transportation Security Administration's policy regarding turbans, 46-year-old Khalsa, though a member of Republican party, did not vote for Trump in this election or in 2016. âI do not think he is morally or ethically fit to be president, especially the leader of the free world. I came to America by choice; for dignity and respect. For the first time as an American, I have felt challenged on those values,â he said. Though he is disillusioned with the current state of affairs of the Republican Party, Khalsa said he has no plan on leaving the GOP. âI do not think the issues lie within the party. It is those like Trump who have twisted the foundation of what it means to be a Republican,â he said. On the election of Indian-origin Kamala Harris as Vice President of the country, Khalsa said that it gives confidence to the people of color and immigrant community. âKamala Harris is a powerful accomplishment for America and provides a ray of hope for relations with India. And her win is just the beginning,â he said. One of the early supporters of Vice President Mike Pence when he was running for Indiana Governor, Khalsa said he is deeply disappointed at the four years of Trump Administration. He alleged that Trump's rhetoric has directly encouraged racism and sexism. âAnd he continues to feed into the narrative of white against black, and poor against rich,â he said. Responding to a question, Khalsa said that it is time for the Indian American community to be active in politics and serve the community they live in. âYou need to give back by serving the community, in whatever capacity you can. One thing to keep in mind is that democracy is not a constant; it needs to be monitored and respected or it will slip away,â he said. In 2007, Khalsa was refused access to board an airplane because of his turban. Thereafter, he mobilised more than 67,000 people nationwide for petitions and took the matter all the way to the US Congress, which forced the Transportation and Security Administration (TSA) to change its headgear policy towards the Sikh community.
