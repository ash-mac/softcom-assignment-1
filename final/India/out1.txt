 Bhawani Sharma, a nursing staff at Kanwatia Hospital in Jaipur, has been spending a lot of time these days doubling up as a self-styled counsellor. Sharma took the Covaxin jab on Saturday when the vaccination drive was rolled out across the country but found many of her colleagues hesitant to roll up their sleeves for a shot of the indigenously-developed Covaxin. âI have had no side effects,â Sharma has been going around telling others in her hospital. Five days into the nationwide drive â which saw the first phase being rolled out for healthcare workers in the frontline of Covid duty â and the dilemma whether to take the Covaxin jab has left beneficiaries in a fix. In none of the six cities, where Covaxin was made available, that TOI surveyed, did the percentage of healthcare workers going for the Covaxin shot reach 50%. Till Tuesday evening, Patna and Jaipur had clocked the highest of 49% while Mumbai and Delhi were at 31% and 33% respectively. Hospitals administering the vaccine have reported a higher percentage of beneficiaries taking the Covishield shot. âThere is some hesitancy. We have seen some outright refusals too. However, what has equally contributed to the low acceptability are the glitches in the Co-Win application. We have not been able to intimate beneficiaries on time,â said Dr Lalit Sankhe, nodal officer for Covaxin at Mumbaiâs JJ Hospital, the only centre in Mumbai with Covaxin. In Delhi, doctors have reported a âlittle higher hesitancy for Covaxin due to lack of efficacy data.â Covaxin is being administered in six central government-run hospitals in Delhi whereas Covishield is being given in all state-run and private hospitals. This has led to confusion and dissatisfaction among healthcare workers âSeveral doctors and PG students are not ready to take Covaxin as the third trial of this vaccine is in its initial stage. At least, the efficacy rate of Covishield is around 70% after its final trial,â said Dr Vinay Kumar, a senior resident at the AIIMS-Patna. In Pune, an official of the district hospital in Aundh said there was a general feeling among healthcare workers that they were being used as âguinea pigsâ. âThere are reports of anaphylactic reactions. I have decided to wait and I have also asked my junior doctors to wait,â said a senior gynecologist based in Chennai. (With inputs from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Patna, Jaipur and Pune)

 NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday addressed the 18th Convocation of Tezpur University, Assam through video-conferencing. He appealed to the youth to work for new India with courage and determination through the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign. He emphasized that the university students should work for the betterment of North East and Assam so that the region should reach newer heights of progress. "Our nation is entering the 75th year of independence. Innumerable people of Assam had contributed towards freedom. Several people had sacrificed their lives, their youth. Now you have to live for New India and Atmanirbhar India," PM Modi said. During his address, he also hailed the country's scientists and health professionals for effectively tackling the Covid-19 pandemic. "Atmanirbhar Bharat is not only about technological advancement and progress. It has become part of everyday life of the nation," he said. In this context, he referred to the miraculous victory of the young Indian cricket team in Australia which overcame multiple challenges to win the Test match series. He termed it as a "life lesson". How Team India can make World Test Championship final"The Indian team in Australia is a great example of the change in approach. Even after losing the first test, they continued fighting. Even after suffering injuries, our players kept fighting for wins and kept looking for new solutions. In challenging conditions, they stood up to challenge. Some players may have been less experienced, but their bravery was no less. They created history with the right talent and temperament. They defeated such an experienced team like Australia. This performance of our players is a life lesson," he said. He further said that people should not be afraid of taking risks and doing experiments. "The first lesson is we should be confident about our ability. The second is if we move forward with a positive mindset then the result will also come positive. The third is if you have an option to go out safely and on the other hand you have an option of a win then you should explore the possibility of a win. Even if you lose, while trying to win, it can't be considered as a loss. You should not be afraid of taking risks and doing experiments. We have to be proactive and fearless," PM said. Lauding Tezpur University, he said that the varsity is running a campaign to conserve North East's biodiversity and rich heritage.   Video courtesy Tezpur University He also said that students at varsity's grassroots innovations add impetus to 'vocal for local'. These innovations help solve local problems and thus, opening new doors towards development, he said. "The effect of converting waste into energy is massive as well. Remains of crops have been a big challenge for both our farmers and the environment. The work that you are doing on technology related to bio-gas and organic fertilisers can solve a major problem in India," PM said. (With inputs from agencies)

 NEW DELHI: The Centre has asked all states and Union Territories to tighten security during Tuesday's 'Bharat Bandh' called by the farmers unions and supported by opposition parties, while asserting that peace and tranquillity must be maintained on that day, officials said. In a countrywide advisory, the Union Home Ministry also said the state governments and UT administrations must ensure that the Covid-19 guidelines issued with regard to health and social distancing are strictly followed. The 'Bharat Bandh' has been called by the farmers unions who have been protesting the three farm laws enacted in the Monsoon Session of Parliament. Major political parties on Sunday came out in strong support of the bandh. Here is all you want to know about new farm laws.  Key provisions of the lawsThe key provisions of new farm laws are intended to help small and marginal farmers (86% of total farmers) who donât have means to either bargain for their produce to get a better price or invest in technology to improve the productivity of farms. The Act on Agri market allows farmers to sell their produce outside APMC âmandisâ to whoever they want. Anyone can buy their produce even at their farm gates. Though âcommission agentsâ of the âmandisâ and states could lose 'commissions' and 'mandi fees' respectively (the main reasons for the current protests), farmers will get better prices through competition and cost-cutting on transportation.The law on contract farming will, on the other hand, allow farmers to enter into a contract with agri-business firms or large retailers on pre-agreed prices of their produce. This will help small and marginal farmers as the legislation will transfer the risk of market unpredictability from the farmer to the sponsor. The third law seeks to remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities. This provision will attract private sector/foreign direct investment into the agriculture sector.  What farmers fear:Farmer unions in Punjab and Haryana say the recent laws enacted at the Centre will dismantle the minimum support price (MSP) system. Over time big corporate houses will dictate terms and farmers will end up getting less for their crops, they argue. Farmers fear that with the virtual disbanding of the mandi system, they will not get an assured price for their crops and the âarthiyasâ -- commission agents who also pitch in with loans for them -- will be out of business. Farmers demands:The key demand is the withdrawal of the three laws which deregulate the sale of their crops. The farmer unions could also settle for a legal assurance that the MSP system will continue, ideally through an amendment to the laws.They are also pressing for the withdrawal of the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020, fearing it will lead to an end to subsidised electricity. Farmers say rules against stubble burning should also not apply to them. How MSP affects farmersMSP is the minimum price paid by the government when it procures any crop from the farmers. It is announced by the state-run Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) for more than 22 commodities on an annual basis, after calculating the cost of cultivation. Food Corporation of India (FCI) -- which is the main state-run grain procurement agency -- largely buys only paddy and wheat at these prices. The FCI then sells these foodgrains at highly subsidised prices to the poor and is thereafter compensated by the government for its losses. What the government saysThe three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. Until 2020, the first sale of agriculture produce could occur only at the mandis of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC). However, after the Farmersâ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 came into force it allows farmers to sell outside APMC mandis in India.

Provisional data compiled by the health ministry showed that 31,466 people were vaccinated in 693 sessions in these states till 6.30 pm on the ninth day. Only 10 adverse events after immunisation were reported on Sunday. So far, 16,13,667 beneficiaries have been inoculated against Covid-19 since the vaccination drive was rolled out on January 16 with two vaccines â Oxford University and AstraZeneca developed Covishield and Bharat Biotechâs Covaxin â both of which are being manufactured locally.

 KOLKATA/GUWAHATI:: As farmers exercise their constitutional right to protest in New Delhi, the locality of Kalgachia in the minoritydominated district of Barpeta in lower Assam will also engage with the Constitution, albeit in a different way. This Republic Day, Kalgachia, 120km from Guwahati, will get Assamâs fourth Samvidhaan Seva Kendra (SSK) or Constitution centre. A year and a half since the NRC exercise and months before the assembly election, a grassroots movement in the state is making the Constitution accessible to those that need it most â the poor and marginalised Muslims of Bengali-origin (Miyas), caught in Assamâs citizenship tangle. Since December 2020, community members, local groups, and lawyers have established SSKs in three districts. The first came up in Barpetaâs TND Bazaar last year; the next two in Sontoli (Kamrup) and Jorhat in January. Working out of unassuming buildings, the SSKs give pride of place to Assamese translations of the Preamble. The name is reminiscent of the Aadhaar seva kendra, but there the similarity ends. The SSKs double up as legal aid centres and community spaces for people marked âdoubtful (D)â voters, âsuspected foreignersâ, or âdeclared foreignersâ in detention centres. âOur job is to facilitate legal aid for people asked to prove their citizenship. We want to familiarise the community with the Constitution and the rights it guarantees,â Aman Wadud, a human rights lawyer who started the initiative, said. Jorhat in upper Assam â the hub of the anti-CAA protests â also has an SSK, inaugurated on January 20. âDuring my social work, I have seen the most poor get marked âDâ voters. If the authorities visit them, they flee as they are unaware of the rights provided by the Constitution. The SSK will act like a hospital emergency ward they can approach,â Toufiqul Hussain, 58, an indigenous Muslim resident of Jorhat, said of the SSK that runs out of a 149-year-old mosque.

 NEW DELHI: Innocuous though it may seem, polls for the central election committee of Congress will open the entire decision-making process in the organisation outside the official group, a reason why it has emerged as the latest bone of contention in the party. The Congress constitution is so designed that election to the CEC will force the leadership to set up the parliamentary board, which is a key demand â besides elections to the post of party president and the Congress Working Committee â of the dissident group known as the G-23. This demand was the reason for the spat in the CWC meeting held on Friday, where the group loyal to the Gandhis led by Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot and Ambika Soni and the G-23 led by Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma and Mukul Wasnik clashed. Though the CEC is merely a deliberative body which decides party candidates for assembly and parliamentary polls, a nod to its election would mean the party would have to constitute the parliamentary board â the top body on parliamentary issues which was discontinued by then party chief and PM P V Narasimha Rao in 1992. Article 25B of the Congress constitution says, âA CEC shall be set up consisting of members of the parliamentary board and nine other members elected by the AICC for the purpose of....â On the other hand, the parliamentary board, as per the Congress constitution (Article 25A), is set up by the CWC and consists of nine members, including the leader of Congress in Parliament. The Congress chief is its chairperson. While Congress has agreed to hold elections for the party president and the CWC, it has not yet spelt out whether it will set up the parliamentary board. âThe push for election to the CEC is designed by dissidents to ensure an across-the-board say in decision-making. Whoever has thought of it has read the party constitution and is being clever. It is not the central election committee but the parliamentary board that they are eyeing,â a Congress insider said.

 NEW DELHI: Attacking the Modi government over record jump in fuel prices, Congress on Sunday demanded that the Centre roll back excise duty on petrol and diesel imposed in the last six years. The party said the government should explain how it had spent the Rs 20 lakh crore earned through additional excise on fuel. âModiji has shown tremendous growth in âGDPâ ie gasdiesel-petrol prices. The public is plagued by inflation, Modi government is busy in tax collection,â Rahul Gandhi tweeted. Speaking to reporters, party spokesman Ajay Maken said excise duty on diesel was raised by 820% and on petrol by 258% during the BJPâs term. âWhen the UPA government was in power, the price of crude oil was $108 per barrel, but petrol and diesel were at Rs 71.5 and Rs 57.3 per litre, which have now increased to Rs 85.7 and Rs 75.8 in Delhi. This, when crude oil is far less than half of the rates during the UPA,â he said. Maken said without excise duty, the price of petrol would be Rs 61.9 per litre and diesel Rs 47.5 per litre, adding that excise duty on petrol was Rs 23.7 per litre and on diesel Rs 28.3. âThe government should explain where exactly this money has gone,â he said.

 KOLKATA: Taking exception to PM Modiâs âsilenceâ on Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee being greeted with chants of âJai Shri Ramâ at Saturdayâs official Netaji birth anniversary event in Kolkata, Trinamool Congress on Sunday termed the conduct of a section of the audience âmisogynisticâ and an affront to what Subhas Chandra Bose stood for. âPM Modi did not utter a single word to condemn the behaviour of a section of the audience...This shows BJP has no respect for Netaji and has no idea of what he stood for,â minister Bratya Basu said. He accused BJP of trying to promote âa certain concept of Lord Ramâ in Bengal. âBengalâs concept of Ram, which we have grown up with, entails respect for women. Those who used Sri Ramâs name in their slogans at Victoria (Memorial) neither respect Ram nor women.â Trinamool MP Abhishek Banerjee said, âMamata Banerjee is a CM elected by 2.5 crore people in Bengal. By not allowing her to speak, she was insulted.â Mamata had been invited to speak at the event in Victoria Memorial ahead of the PM, but she returned to her seat the moment some in the crowd uttered âJai Shri Ramâ. Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said, âThis wasnât a political programme. This was a government programme. Their understanding of what should be said where, is slightly less.â Many among the bevy of celebrities who attended the event, including some who have been critical of TMC, said they loved everything about the event other than the row over âJai Shri Ramâ. Responding to the outrage, BJP demanded to know if Mamataâs refusal to speak at the event amid chants of âJai Shri Ramâ was a political stance or not. Netajiâs grandnephew Chandra Kumar Bose, who had contested the South Kolkata Lok Sabha seat on a BJP ticket, criticised the CM over her reaction to the chant.

 DHARAPURAM: Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said the Chinese gathered guts to intrude into the Indian territory because of a weakening economy which was the result of flawed policies of âweakâ PM Modi. âThe Chinese understand that the man running this country is weak. They understand that the PM has destroyed the economy of India. That is why they are inside our territory,â Rahul said on Sunday at Dharapuram town in Tirupur district of Tamil Nadu. âAs we speak today, thousands of Chinese troops are occupying our territory and the man with a 56-inch chest cannot even say the word China. That is the reality of our country,â he said. He spoke on similar lines earlier in the day while addressing weavers in Erode. On day two of his three-day election campaign in Tamil Nadu, Rahul focused on attacking Modi rather than the AIADMK dispensation, which he sought to replace with a government that âcannot be controlled by BJPâ. Rahul said BJPâs economic policies had âdealt a severe blow to farmers, weavers, labourers and MSMEsâ, who are foundation of the country. âI can tell you without doubt if the Indian economy was strong, China would have never got the guts to step into India,â Rahul said.

 NALBARI/KOKRAJHAR: Home minister Amit Shah on Sunday launched BJPâs Assam campaign, promising that the party would âexposeâ Congressâ secular credentials and highlighted the latterâs alliance with Badruddin Ajmal-led AIUDF. Addressing a rally in BJPâs stronghold of Nalbari in lower Assam, Shah sought another five years after the party formed a government for the first time in 2016 to continue the pace of development and keep the state safe from "violence, corruption, agitations and also floodsâ, a major bane for the state. Shah said while BJP has managed to contain infiltrators, Congress and AIUDF would open the floodgates for them. The minister cited Congressâs alliances with the Muslim League in Kerala and Ajmal in Assam and said the opposition party should stop shedding crocodile tears in the guise of âsecularismâ. BJP has planned five big rallies before assembly poll dates are announced. âCan Congress and Ajmal keep Assam free from infiltrators? If they come to power, they will open all gates to welcome them because they are their vote bank,â Shah said and took swipe at Congress for dubbing BJP âcommunalâ. Shah also addressed the issue of extremism, saying PM Modi was on a mission to end militancy in the entire northeast with the signing of the Bodo accord one year ago. âThe PM started ending the unrest not only in Assam but the entire northeast and it started with the Bodo peace agreement, followed by the Bru-Reang agreement. Today the era of violence is coming to an end and the era of peace is beginning,â he said. He added that the PM had scrapped Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution from J&K and in the recent panchayat elections, police did not have to shoot a single bullet and peaceful polling took place. He said an assistance of Rs 4 lakh had been started for all surrendered militants and work of honouring the Bodo language was also being done and the long pending demand was fulfilled by according it the status of the stateâs co-language.

 NEW DELHI: For Sunitha Dugar and her four companions who are part of a national âSafe Speed Challengeâ, driving on Indian roads is nothing less than âplaying a video gameâ in real life and one doesnât know who will come from where on to the road. âWhen you are driving on the road, you should be prepared for surprises. So, itâs your responsibility to save yourself and save others. Itâs actually a real video game on the road risking many lives,â said Sunita, an entrepreneur from Chennai. The five women from different walks of life are participating in the challenge that was flagged off by defence minister Rajnath Singh and road transport minister Nitin Gadkari from Wagah to Kanyakumari. Several factors, including poor infrastructure, unsafe driving, inadequate enforcement and trauma care have made Indian roads unsafe claiming 415 lives daily. Speaking to TOI, Neha Dua from Noida said, âWe lack safety culture. More than speeding, speed management is the biggest challenge. You hardly find signage and road markings to help driversâ. For Chaitanya Kehlot from Bengaluru, the challenges have been manoeuvring between trucks, rickshaws and cyclists etc. For Amritha Avind, another Bangalorean, the biggest challenge are people not following the traffic rules and confusing signals. Garima Avtar, the first woman who has been driving professionally for Mercedes Benz Luxe Drive since 2016, the biggest challenge is the mechanism and procedures for issuing licences. âPeople who are not fit to drive and donât know the traffic guidelines properly are able to obtain driving licences. This makes our roads dangerous,â she said.

 VARANASI: The photographs posted by Indian team cricketer and left-handed opener Shikhar Dhawan of feeding birds during a boat ride in the Ganga during his recent visit to Varanasi almost landed him in trouble since the district administration had imposed a strict ban on feeding birds due to the bird flu scare. The administration, however, gave a reprieve to Dhawan and decided to spare him, but has initiated action against the boatman, who did not stop the cricketer and did not inform him about the ban. The boatman is being identified and traced and will face action. Almost a week after the administration had imposed a ban, Dhawan had visited Kashi and fed migratory birds during a boat ride. The flouting of ban came to light when he himself uploaded pictures of his Kashi visit on his Instagram account on Friday, also including the one of feeding birds with a caption âHappiness is feeding birdsâ. When TOI contacted district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma on Sunday to know the action being initiated in this episode, he said, âTourists are generally not aware about local issues, directives and guidelines. Apart from river police and Varanasi Municipal Corporation, the boatmen had been made accountable for ensuring strict compliance of the ban. Hence, action would be taken against the boatman.â The district administration had taken note of the incident on Saturday and the river police were asked to search the boatman, who took him on a boat ride but did not stop him from feeding birds. The boatman could not be traced till Sunday evening. Dhawan had visited Kashi and posted photos of offering prayer at Kaal Bhairav temple on January 20.

 BAREILY: An octogenarian woman, who was mistakenly declared dead in legal documents, has been fighting a hard and lonely battle in Uttar Pradeshâs Moradabad district â to prove that she is alive. The woman reached out to the district administration officials during the recently held Sampoorna Samadhan Diwas and complained that she had not received the widowsâ pension for two years. The woman Sharifan, 80, claimed that she had been running from pillar to post, but to no avail. Officials said that a probe has been ordered into the case. âThe pension was stopped abruptly around two years ago. We made efforts to approach the officials, but nothing was done. It was later learned that her name was removed from the list of widowsâ pension beneficiaries as she was declared dead,â said Shariq Ali, a relative. âI tried to meet the officials concerned. Since then, I have been struggling to get my pension,â Sharifan said. Meanwhile, Moradabad sub-divisional magistrate Prashant Tiwari said, âIt has come to light that the woman was declared dead and stopped receiving her widowsâ pension. It is negligence on the part of officials. Local officials have been told to rectify the error.â

 AHMEDABAD: The auto driver who had approached the Gujarat high court seeking to be declared an atheist, has filed another petition for permission to not mention caste and religion in the certificates for all those who do not want such details mentioned. For himself, petitioner Rajveer Upadhyay (36), sought directions to the authorities to state âNo Religion, No Casteâ in his certificates because he does not want to notify the same. Upadhyay, who belongs to the scheduled Garo-Brahmin caste, mentioned in his petition that he has faced many troubles in life due to the discriminatory caste system. For removal of mention of religion and caste from his certificates, Upadhyay once again relied on the certificate issued to one Sneha Vellore by Tamil Nadu authorities and ratified by the Madras high court. He has also sought the removal of the mention of father/husbandâs name and surname from certificates if people are not willing to mention them, contending that authorities cannot compel people to mention such details. He has urged the HC to direct concerned authorities to remove these details from his and his daughterâs certificates besides arguing that orphans and women with multiple divorces always face this problem and feel humiliated.

 HYDERABAD: In a first such move, bar councils of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala on Sunday came together and unanimously demanded a Supreme Court bench in south India. The councils said, they made the demand keeping in mind the people who end up relinquishing the idea of accessing the highest court of justice due to lack of reach and their inability to afford the costs of reaching a faraway Supreme Court. The chiefs of these bar councils deliberated on this demand at a webinar organised by the Telangana state bar council. They elected Telangana bar council chairman A Narasimha Reddy as convenor of the committee formed to achieve this goal. Though the demand for a SC bench has been there for a while, it is for the first time that top legal experts from the region have jointly vowed to fight for it. Reddy said it was incomprehensible as to why the SC is not setting up its appellate benches in four parts of the country. âThe Supreme Court at Delhi can exclusively concentrate on constitutional issues while its appellate benches in the four corners would decide the appeals emanating from the high courts,â he said. The bar councils unanimously resolved to seek an appointment and meet President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu, PM Narendra Modi, law minister, the Chief Justice of India, and all the judges of the Supreme Court in the coming days. The delegation will brief them about the problems faced by the people of south India, whose cases are pending at the high courts because reaching the Supreme Court is considered âimpracticalâ in terms of affordability, the delegates said. The meeting also decried the exorbitant fees charged by advocates of the Supreme Court. This is making the top court affordable only by the rich and the corporates, they said.

 MUMBAI: A sales tax officer, dead for almost two decades, has 25 years after his conviction been acquitted in a corruption and refunds conspiracy case of 1985. A few days ago, Bombay high court allowed his appeal against conviction. His widow and son had in 2015 stepped into his shoes to continue with the appeal filed in 1996, against the conviction, an 18 month imprisonment and Rs 26000 fine. In September 1996 a special trial court in Solapur had convicted Suresh Kagne and two other sales tax officials, relying largely on the testimony of an approver â the son of another co-accused, an oil mill owner. He had been granted pardon at the fag end of the trial after 92 of the 94 prosecution witnesses were examined, âobviously to fill up lacunae in the case,ââ said the HC in its judgmenton January 19. Kagne was tried with two other public servants and a registered âdealerâ of an oil extraction business and his son. The charges included conspiracy to making and securing a false claim of refund of sales tax, admissible to those engaged in business of extracting oil from oilseeds and âtel ghanisâ (mini oil mills). A co-accused had granted registration to the dealerâs son. Kagne had allegedly âwithout following due process accepted the claims for set off ââ of Rs 2.6 lakh, thus causing a loss to the state exchequer. The HC did not find the approverâs testimony reliable. Earlier in 2013, the HC had acquitted two of Kagneâs co-accused, also sales tax officials, while allowing their separate appeals against their conviction.

 AHMEDABAD: If a pregnancy after a failed sterilisation procedure wasnât enough, a mother of five from Gujaratâs Gandhinagar district was not offered timely abortion too, resulting in the birth of a disabled sixth child. A court recently ordered authorities to pay her around Rs 3.4 lakh compensation with interest, besides Rs 1,500 monthly maintenance till the child turns 18. The woman, a resident of Kalolâs Sherisa village, will also get Rs 10,000 towards mental agony and Rs 5,000 for legal expenses. The amount will be paid with 6% interest by the health officer of the primary health centre, district health officer, health commissioner and district collector. In February 2007, Premila Thakor opted for a sterilisation operation. To her dismay, however, she conceived for the sixth time. She approached the Hajipur PHC for an abortion but was redirected to a private facility which sought Rs 9,000 for terminating the pregnancy. Unable to afford the fee, she gave birth to a son with disability. She sued the medical officer at Hajipur PHC, the district health officer, health commissioner and district collector along with an insurance company that was liable to pay Rs 30,000 in case of failed sterilisation. Premila told the court that because of the pregnancy, she had to suffer mental stress and physical pain, and demanded Rs 1,500 monthly maintenance to raise her son till he turns 18, besides Rs 5 lakh compensation towards doctorsâ negligence. The court refused to believe authoritiesâ claim that the pregnancy was at an advanced stage. It added that the disabled child wouldnât have been born if the defendants had terminated the unwanted pregnancy timely.

She approached the Hajipur PHC for an abortion but was redirected to a private facility which sought Rs 9,000 for terminating the pregnancy. Unable to afford the fee, she gave birth to a son with disability. She sued the medical officer at Hajipur PHC, the district health officer, health commissioner and district collector along with an insurance company that was liable to pay Rs 30,000 in case of failed sterilisation. Premila told the court that because of the pregnancy, she had to suffer mental stress and physical pain, and demanded Rs 1,500 monthly maintenance to raise her son till he turns 18, besides Rs 5 lakh compensation towards doctorsâ negligence. The court refused to believe authoritiesâ claim that the pregnancy was at an advanced stage. It added that the disabled child wouldnât have been born if the defendants had terminated the unwanted pregnancy timely.

 NEW DELHI: On National Votersâ Day on Monday, the Election Commission will roll out the âe-EPICâ, a noneditable and secure PDF version of the electoral photo identity card (EPIC) that can be downloaded on the mobile phone or in a self-printable form on the computer. The e-EPIC facility â to be launched by law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, âguest of honourâ at ECâs 2021 National Votersâ Day event on Monday, by distributing e-EPICs and EPIC cards to five new voters âwill eliminate the wait for delivery of the physical EPIC card after it is approved. Now, immediately upon approval EPIC will be downloadable. Electors can print the card, self-laminate it or store it digitally, as per convenience. The e-EPIC shall be in addition to the plastic voter EPIC card being issued upon fresh registration. The e-EPIC can be uploaded by the voter on digilocker and stored securely with other documents. All new electors registered during special summary revision 2021 â those who applied during November-December 2020 â and whose mobile number provided while applying is unique, will get an SMS and may download e-EPIC between January 25 and 31, 2021. Thereafter, all other general electors will be able to download their e-EPIC w.e.f February 1, 2021, in case they are having unique mobile number in the e-Roll. Alternatively, they will have to undergo (KYC) process before downloading the e-EPIC. The e-EPIC will eliminate the need for a voter to get a new card made each time there is a change in address on account of migration. A single e-EPIC card would suffice, with only changed address in QR code, which can be downloaded afresh. This would enable the principle of âOne nation â one election cardâ. Voters who have lost or damaged their EPIC card will be able to download duplicate cards for free. Currently, this facility entails a payment of Rs 25. National Voters' Day is celebrated on January 25 every year since 2011 to mark the foundation day of ECI. President Ram Nath Kovind will be the chief guest this year and will launch ECâs web radio, âHello Votersâ.

 MUMBAI: When there is âno direct physical contact â skin to skin with sexual intent, without penetration,â it would not amount to âsexual assaultâ under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, Bombay high court held while acquitting a 39-year-old man who had been sentenced to three yearsâ imprisonment under section 8 of the Act by a trial court for pressing the breasts of a minor. Justice Pushpa Ganediwala of Nagpur bench of the HC said âstricter proof and serious allegations are requiredââ given the stringent punishment of three to five yearsâ imprisonment that âsexual assaultâ under the Pocso Act entails. âEvidently, it is not the case of the prosecution that the appellant removed her top and pressed her breast,â said Justice Ganediwala adding, âThe act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years, in the absence of any specific detail as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hand inside the top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of âsexual assaultââ. But it would attract punishment for molestation under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), said the HC, and convicted him for the âminor offenceâ. He was sentenced to one year in jail. The HC said the issue before it was whether âpressing of breastâ and âattempt to remove salwarâ would fall within the definition of âsexual assaultâ as defined under Section 7 and punishable under Section 8 of the Pocso Act. While public prosecutor MJ Khan argued the offence fell within the definition of âsexual assaultâ, the HC held it was ânot possible to acceptââ the prosecutorâs submission. The court said the âbasic principle of criminal jurisprudence is that punishment shall be proportional to seriousness of crimeâ. The trial court in Nagpur had last February sentenced the man under section 8 of the Pocso Act and under section 354 IPC (assault or criminal force with intent to outrage a womanâs modesty). The man had appealed his conviction. The girl had testified that she was lured on a false pretext by the accused to his house. She said he had tried to remove her salwar and had pressed her breast. She tried to shout, but he covered her mouth and left the room after bolting the door from outside. Her mother went to his house while looking for her. She had seen the accused leave, and on reaching the first floor found the door bolted from outside and her daughter crying inside. She then went to the police station along with her daughter to lodge an FIR, noted the HC. The man was on bail. The HC issued a non-bailable warrant against him and said all his other sentences shall run concurrently and he would be entitled for a set-off of term undergone in custody.

 THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Keralaâs LDF government has referred to the CBI sexual harassment cases filed against five Congress leaders, including former chief minister Oommen Chandy and AICC general secretary K C Venugopal, and BJP national vice-president A P Abdullakutty, based on complaints from the prime accused in the solar scam. The decision to transfer the cases registered by the crime branch 27 months ago was taken in the cabinet meeting last week and notified as an extraordinary gazette on Saturday. The order notified six crime cases registered by the crime branch CID in 2018 and conveyed consent under Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act so that the CBI can probe these cases in the state. The state government had, in the first week of November last year, withdrawn general consent for a CBI probe in the state. The CBI can probe only those cases referred by the government or ordered by the courts in the state now. Besides Chandy, Venugopal and Adullakutty, the cases referred are those against MPs Adoor Prakash and Hibi Eden, and former minister and MLA A P Anilkumar. Though the complainant had levelled harassment allegations against 10 more leaders, including former MP and new LDF ally Jose K Mani, the crime branch hasnât registered FIRs against them. The detailed statements of the complainant have been recorded only in these six cases. Welcoming the CBI probe, the complainant said she stood by her allegations against all leaders, including Jose K Mani, and hoped that the CBI would nail the culprits.

 The declining Covid-19 pandemic in India slumped below another significant milestone on Sunday when weekly cases fell under the one-lakh mark for the first time in seven months. India recorded 96,025 fresh cases in the week (January 18-24), the lowest number since 93,801 infections were reported in June 14-21, which was also the last week when less than one lakh cases of the virus were registered in the country, as per TOIâs database collated from state government numbers. Weekly cases had touched a peak of 6,45,014 in September 6-13 before falling nearly uninterruptedly till the present week. At present, weekly cases are down to just 15% of the number recorded at the peak. This week, cases saw an 8.7% drop from the previous seven days. This was the 11th consecutive week of decline in cases. Since hitting the peak, cases have logged a rise in only one week, the one before Diwali. Recorded deaths from the virus registered a week-on-week fall of 16.4%. There were 1,052 fatalities reported during the week, down from 1,259 in the previous seven days. The death toll has now fallen for seven weeks in a row. Covid-related fatalities have fallen to nearly one-eighth of the number recorded at the peak, when the country had reported 8,175 deaths in a single week (September 14-20). Overall, the pandemic has officially claimed 1,53,454 lives in the country so far, the third highest toll in the world after the US (nearly 4.3 lakh deaths) and Brazil (2.2 lakh). Indiaâs total Covid-19 caseload stood at close to 10.7 million (10,668,706), behind only the US's tally of 25.5 million. However, while most of the worst-hit countries have seen a second, or even a third, surge in the pandemic, India's cases have declined steadily so far since the mid-September peak. In the current week, active cases in the country have fallen by 11.3%, from close to 2.1 lakh to nearly 1.86 lakh. On Sunday, India recorded 13,266 fresh cases, down from 14,891 reported on the previous day. Daily deaths too dropped below 150 for the first time in five days, with 131 fatalities on Sunday. Kerala continued to register by far the highest number of fresh cases at 6,036. This was the six straight day of above 6,000 new cases in the state, the only one in the country where the pandemic appears to be on the upsurge. Maharashtra again reported the highest deaths at 45, followed by Kerala (20), Delhi (nine) and Uttar Pradesh, Bengal and Chhattisgarh (eight each). Maharashtra recorded below 3,000 (2,752) new positive cases for the fourth day in a row and saw a marginal drop in deaths, while Mumbai registered below 500 (479) new cases on the third consecutive day and a slight drop in deaths. Active cases in the state saw a marginal rise while the city's active cases reduced.

 NEW DELHI: Granting a formal nod to protesting farmers to hold the tractor rally or âKisan Gantantra Paradeâ in the city on January 26, Delhi Police commissioner S N Shrivastava on Sunday asked his officers and central reserve police personnel deployed for Republic Day Parade security to remain âready to move at short notice to handle any law and order situationâ arising out of the tractor rally. Police have chalked out three elaborate routes for the rally, which will begin, just after the Republic Day Parade concludes, from three city border points at Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur and later return to the originating points. Around 12,000 tractors were seen at the borders on Sunday, but the final figure for the rally would be available by Monday evening, cops said. Delhi Police, who have also spoken to their Haryana and UP counterparts about the rally, will not only oversee law and order during it to ensure it is âpeacefulâ, but will also provide security to it so that âmischievous elementsâ canât infiltrate it and cause unrest. From Singhu, the rally will pass through Kanjhawala, Bawana, Auchandi border, KMP Expressway before returning (62km). From Tikri border, it will go to Nagloi and pass through Najafgarh and Western Peripheral Expressway (62km). From Ghazipur border, the rally will head for 56-foot road, Apsara border, Hapur and then return while passing through KMP/Western Peripheral Expressway (46km), Delhi Police spokesperson and special commissioner (intelligence) Dependra Pathak said. âWe have shared with the farm unions a list of arrangements we need to make to ensure the event is peaceful. We conveyed to them how the Republic Day is a day of national pride and so there shouldnât be any hindrance to the main parade,â Pathak said. âWe will continue to talk to teh unions to ensure the rally is held under secure circumstances,â he added. âFarm volunteers will work with us to guarantee security arrangements. This will be a challenging task, but details/arrangements are being made for the same, including area security checks, deployment and medical emergencies,â special CP Pathak said. âWe have full faith in our farmers and are hopeful the arrangements will be according to our dialogues.â

 NEW DELHI: An Indonesian spa therapist working in Chennai, who was granted a compensation of Rs 2.5 lakh by the Madras high court for her illegal detention in a womenâs home following a police raid at the spa, has now moved the Supreme Court challenging a subsequent HC order providing relief to the police inspector involved in the action. The HC had ordered TN government to recover the compensation amount from the salary of the inspector in monthly instalments. Later, a division bench stayed the deductions. For years, spa owners, female therapists and masseuses have worked under the constant fear of raids by police, who routinely invoke the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Children Act to send female workers to womenâs homes while accusing spas of indulging in flesh trade. A similar raid was conducted by a Chennai police team led by inspector K Natarajan in October 2018 in which several female workers at a spa were detained. One of them was a therapist from Indonesia, Kadek Dwi Ani Rasmini, who had a valid degree, work visa and was an income tax payee in India. She was forced to spend 26 days in a women's home before being released on the intervention of the Indonesian embassy. And she has not taken this ignominy and harassment lying down. Rasmini moved the Madras high court questioning the ulterior motive behind the raid and alleged that it was because of the inspector wreaking vengeance for his constant run-ins with the spa owner. She alleged that her detention was without any reason and evidence. She demanded Rs 10 lakh as compensation for the illegal detention, loss of personal reputation, harassment and mental agony. A single judge bench of the Madras HC gave a stinging order, termed the police action illegal and attempted to restore the dignity at workplace for female workers at spas. It ordered the Tamil Nadu government to pay Rasmini a compensation of Rs 2.5 lakh through the Indonesian embassy and directed the state to recover the amount from the police inspector in equal instalments. Justice Anand Venkatesh said, âThe petitioner came into this country with the fond hope that her services will be used as a massage therapist and that she will be adequately compensated. She could not have thought even in the remotest of her dreams that she would be confined at a home by the police for 26 days. The petitioner has undergone a horrific experience at the hands of the first respondent (Natarajan), and I am sure that she will have a very bad impression about this country and its system." After 286 days of the judgment, that is much after the 90-day limitation period, the police inspector filed an appeal against the judgment so far as it directed recovery of Rs 2.5 lakh, the compensation awarded to Rasmini, from his salary. He did not challenge quashing of the criminal case registered after the raid on the spa. A division bench agreed to condone the huge delay, entertained the appeal and ordered a stay on further deduction of equated monthly instalments from the inspectorâs salary. Rasmini, however, was not ready to give up. She moved the Supreme Court, challenging the division benchâs decision to entertain the inspectorâs appeal despite the inexplicable and enormous delay. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, B R Gavai and Krishna Murari issued notice to the police inspector on Friday and asked him to respond within three weeks. What the single judge bench of the HC said rings a bell about the general attitude of police towards spas. âPolice have no legal right to prevent a health spa being operated by anyone even if the therapy is done by persons of one sex to those belonging to the opposite sex. A health spa providing cross-gender massages is a worldwide phenomenon and there is no legal prohibition except, to borrow the wordings of the Supreme Court, the majoritarian impulses rooted in moralistic tradition which is attempting to impinge upon individual autonomy,â he said.

 NEW DELHI: India on Sunday once again asked China for âcomplete disengagement and de-escalationâ at all the face-off sites in eastern Ladakh, amid a deepening trust deficit due to the continuing consolidation of military positions by the Chinese Army all along the frontier. Sources said India pushed for finalisation of a âworkable and sequentialâ roadmap for disengagement, de-escalation and de-induction, with a joint verification mechanism, while restoring status quo ante at the âfriction pointsâ in Pangong Tso, Chushul and Gogra-Hotsprings areas as the first step. There was, however, no official word on the outcome of the ninth round of military talks, led by 14 Corps commander Lt-General P G K Menon and South Xinjiang Military District chief Major General Liu Lin, which lasted for over 10 hours on the Chinese side of the Chushul-Moldo border meeting point on Sunday. âWith hardened positions on both sides, any tangible breakthrough seems unlikely at this stage. The two delegations will now go to their respective political hierarchies for further directions on the proposals and counter-proposals exchanged during the talks,â a source said. The Indian defence establishment is wary that China has no real intentions of a pullback of troops, tanks and howitzers from the frontlines, given the way it has consolidated its military positions and upgraded its infrastructure all along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control (LAC) after the Ladakh confrontation erupted in early May. The Peopleâs Liberation Army (PLA) has assiduously built new roads and lateral links, surface-to-air missile positions and helipads in different sectors stretching from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, while also establishing civilian settlements in âdisputed but occupied areasâ in the eastern sector, as reported by TOI earlier. âBut talks are important to maintain the calm at the frontlines,â the source said. China has been demanding that the proposed disengagement should begin from the south bank of Pangong Tso-Chushul area, where Indian troops occupied tactically advantageous positions on the ridgeline stretching from Thakung to Gurung Hill, Spanggur Gap, Magar Hill, Mukhpari, Rezang La and Reqin La (Rechin mountain pass) on August 28-30 last year. But with these Kailash ranges in Chushul sector providing India with some leverage in the negotiations, India has been pressing for a âsimultaneous whole of eastern Ladakhâ approach for the mutual disengagement. This will include the PLA vacating the 8-km stretch it has occupied from âFinger 4 to 8â (mountainous spurs) on the north bank of Pangong Tso since early May. With its long-standing Dhan Singh Thapa post between Finger 2 and Finger 3, Indian Army has rejected the PLAâs proposal to convert the entire âFinger areaâ into a no-patrol zone. As per India, the LAC runs north to south at Finger 8, even though the current face-off is on the Finger 4 spur. âThe resources with the PLA are simply staggering. With roads leading right till the LAC, the PLA can swiftly move more forces and firepower to the forward areas in the summer. India will now willy-nilly have to treat the LAC (just like) the Line of Control with Pakistan, with permanent deployments and posts,â an officer said. As reported earlier by TOI, the new as well as reinforced PLA military positions are spread from opposite the Daulat Beg Oldie-Depsang, Chushul and Demchok areas in eastern Ladakh, Kaurik Pass in Himachal Pradesh and Barahoti Plains in Uttarakhand to north Doklam near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet trijunction and the Asaphila and âFish Tailâ areas in Arunachal Pradesh. Moreover, additional facilities have been constructed at Chinese airbases facing India like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa (Ngari Gunsa), Lhasa-Gonggar and Shigatse, which include underground hangers and parking bays for fighters by digging tunnels into mountains in some areas.

 NEW DELHI: Remote voting, or allowing a voter to cast her franchise from any polling station in the country and not just the polling station or constituency where she is registered, is among the key future initiatives that the Election Commission is working on, chief election commissioner Sunil Arora said on Sunday and added that mock trials of the project would begin soon. Sharing an âimportant dimension of the vision of Election Commission of India for future electoral processesâ, Arora in a public broadcast on the eve of National Votersâ Day, observed on January 25 each year to mark the foundation day of the EC, said, âWe have already started a research project on remote voting, using cutting edge technology, with IIT-Madras and other institutions and it has made good progress. Mock trials of this project will begin soon.â In each election, thousands of voters have to forego their right to vote on account of a geographical barrier. By virtue of occupation, education, medical treatment or other reasons, there have been instances of current residence of such electors being different from the place of registration in electoral rolls. Remote voting marks a departure from the conventional polling station, which is currently tied to a geographic location. The remote voting project aspires to enable voters residing in remote locations, away from their designated polling stations, to cast their ballot in a secured fashion. The EC is also looking to extend postal ballot facility to overseas voters, who currently need to be physically present at their respective polling stations in the country to be able to vote. Arora said the ECâs proposal in this regard was being considered by the law ministry. Underlining the high voter turnout in Bihar polls last year despite the Covid-19 pandemic, Arora called upon voters of four states and one Union Territory due for assembly polls in April to âcome out to vote in large numbers without any fear, inducement or influence of any typeâ. âWe also hope that you will make effective use of the C-Vigil app launched by the commission as a pilot project in 2018 and extended to the entire country in Lok Sabha elections 2019. It has over a period of time emerged as the most powerful and effective tool for citizen empowerment. We also assure you that we will make all-out arrangements to ensure that the entire voting process and premises are completely sanitised as well as safe for the exercise of your franchise,â he said. Talking of new EC initiatives, Arora said the e-EPIC card would be launched on Monday âfor all our young, newly-enrolled voters to make the process of electoral registration easier and digitalâ. He added that âHello Votersâ, the ECâs web radio, will help to further strengthen the commissionâs engagement with voters. âIn the days to come, this will emerge as the nerve-centre of voter awareness, information sharing, stories from our unsung heroes and election warriors,â the CEC said.

 TIRUPUR: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday slammed the RSS, saying the parent body of the BJP cannot decide the future of Tamil Nadu and it would be determined by the state's people and its youngsters. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has got a 'confusion,' and he thought that just because he can 'blackmail' the government of Tamil Nadu, he could control the people of the state as well, he said addressing a public meeting near here. The Congress leader alleged: "He (Modi) does not understand, only the Tamil people can decide the future of Tamil Nadu. Knickerwallahs (a colloquial reference to shorts, previous organisational uniform of RSS men) from Nagpur can never ever decide the future of the state. Does not matter how many parades (by RSS members) they have. Tamil Nadu's future will be decided by the state's youngsters." He said he was in Tamil Nadu to help people elect a government that would look after the interests of the Tamil people and one that cannot be controlled or blackmailed by the Prime Minister. On the second day of his campaign today, Gandhi said he was helping the people as he owed them a debt for their love and affection. His ties with Tamil Nadu was a 'family relationship,' he said. Attacking Modi over farm laws which he said was against the farmers who along with others like labourers formed the foundation of the nation, Gandhi said, "We will not allow Narendra Modi to destroy the foundation of India." Farmers have been protesting because they understood that "you are robbing their future, you are stealing what is theirs," the Congress MP claimed. He flayed Modi and BJP for 'destroying' India's foundational structure of diversity by imposing an ideology of one language, one culture and one nation. The Central government is not for the farmers, labourers or the Micro Small or Medium Enterprises, that are the nation's future and abound in this region of the state, Gandhi, on a campaign tour of western districts, said. After working against the interests of those who formed the core of the nation's foundation, Modi was silent on the question of China, he alleged. Gandhi is here on a three day tour to campaign for the Tamil Nadu Assembly polls expected in April or early May.

 NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police on Sunday allowed holding of the tractor rally by the farmers in the national capital on Republic Day after the official parade and under strict security arrangements. The farmers will hold the tractor rally as a mark of protest against the centreâs three agri laws. They have claimed that over two lakh tractors will take part in their parade. Amidst reports of over 300 Twitter handles getting generated from Pakistan to disrupt the farmers' tractor rally, the Delhi Police has issued circular for special security arrangements on the day. Here are the key developments of the day: 1. Delhi Police Commissioner SN Srivastava issued a circular regarding the security arrangements for the tractor rally by protesting farmers that will be held after the Republic Day celebration on Tuesday. The circular said that all officers and personnel as well as Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) and any other force deployed for the Republic Day Parade security arrangements should be made aware and be prepared that they will be required for law and order arrangements immediately after the official celebration is over. Arrangements of lunch for police personnel should be made and they be kept in readiness at their points of duty under the charge of their respective zonal/sector officers, it said. On Sunday, the police said the farmers' proposed tractor rally will start after the time period of the Republic Day celebration has ended. The rally will be held from Delhi's three border points - Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur - and adequate security will be provided to it, the police said. 2. Delhi Police has Sunday claimed that over 300 Twitter handles have been generated from Pakistan to disrupt the tractor rally proposed by protesting farmers on Republic Day. Detailing the plan for the tractor parade, Deependra Pathak, Special Commissioner of Police (Intelligence) said the rally on Tuesday will be conducted amid tight security after the Republic Day celebrations conclude. "Over 300 Twitter handles have been generated from Pakistan during January 13 to 18 to disrupt the tractor rally by farmers only by misleading people. There are inputs about the same from different agencies too. It will be a challenging task for us but the rally will be conducted amid tight security after the Republic Day parade is over," Pathak said at a press conference. Pathak said, âAs the farmers wanted to do a tractor rally on January 26, we have come to a conclusion that the rally will be conducted after the timing of the Republic Day Celebration ends. We have given them around 170 kilometres of distance in three routes.â Barricades and other security arrangements will be removed and the farmers will enter the national capital. Later, they will return to their destinations after covering a "respectable" distance, police said. 3. Over two lakh tractors will be part of the January 26 'kisan parade' in the national capital and around 2,500 volunteers will be deployed to facilitate the movement of the vehicles, farmer unions opposing the centre's new agri laws claimed. The number of volunteers can be increased, depending on the crowd, and a control room has been set up to look into the arrangements, they said. Kirti Kisan union president Nirbhai Singh Dhudike, who presided over a meeting of Punjab farmers' unions, said that more than one lakh tractors are expected to arrive from the state on Sunday. The main focus of the meeting was to discuss the tractor parade to be taken on Republic Day, Singh said after the over three-hour-long meeting at Singhu. 4. Protesting farmer leaders have remained firm on their demand of a complete repeal of the three contentious farm laws, and said their immediate focus is on the January 26 tractor parade. The union leaders said the next course of action will be decided only after the tractor parade. "Since the beginning of our agitation, our demand is very clear. We want a complete repeal of these three laws, and we will not settle for anything less than the repeal of the new farm laws," Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni said. He said that farmer unions are currently focusing on their proposed January 26 tractor parade, and after the Republic Day, they will decide on the next course of action. 5. Shooting of actor Janhvi Kapoor's upcoming film âGood Luck Jerryâ was disrupted after a group of farmers held a protest in Patiala, Punjab. The incident took place near the Civil Lines area when protesting farmers opposed the filming of the movie. Shouting slogans against Bollywood, protesters lamented that âno actorâ extended support to farmers' agitation against the centre's three farm laws. âWe are telling the film industry which is holding its shooting in Punjab to at least speak in favour of farmers who are agitating against the legislations,â said a protester Rajwant Singh Sandhu. Another protester said, âWe are opposing Bollywood actors for not extending support to farmers.â They also slammed the centre for imposing âblack lawsâ on the farming community. Some farmers held protest outside the hotel where the film's crew is staying. Earlier this month, shooting of the film had briefly come to a halt at Bassi Pathana in Fatehgarh Sahib after a group of farmers had insisted that Janhvi make a comment on the ongoing farmers' protest. 6. Congress MP Ravneet Singh Bittu was allegedly assaulted, pushed around and his turban pulled off in what he described was a "murderous attack" by some "mischievous elements" at the Singhu border during a 'Jan Sansad' programme. The Ludhiana MP's vehicle was also damaged in the attack at the Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji Memorial where he had gone with Congress' Amritsar MP Gurjeet Singh Aujla and party MLA Kulbir Singh Zira to attend the event. "Some mischievous elements whose intentions were unknown, tried to spoil the situation by launching a murderous attack on three of us," Bittu said in a Facebook post. Bittu, the grandson of former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh who was assassinated in 1995, Aujla and Zira have been holding a protest at the Jantar Mantar in Delhi for the past several days in support of the ongoing farmers' agitation against the Centre's three agriculture laws. 7. The upcoming Parliament session will be "stormy" if farmers' demand of repealing of the new agri laws is not accepted by the government, Congress' Lok Sabha chief whip Kodikunnil Suresh said, asserting that his party will strongly raise the issue of the tillers' agitation in both Houses. The Budget session of Parliament is starting from January 29 and it will be held in two parts. The first part will conclude on February 15 and the second part will be held from March 8 to April 8. Suresh said issues such as farmers' agitation and the purported WhatsApp chats of Republic's editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami will be raised by the Congress strongly. "Our main priority is the farmers' agitation and we plan to strongly raise the farmers' issue both in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. We will make use of all measures such as adjournment motion to discuss and debate the issue," he said. "We are also in touch with like-minded parties to have a joint strategy for the upcoming Parliament session with the main issue being the farmers' agitation," he said. 8. Thousands of farmers from across Maharashtra reached Mumbai on Sunday evening to participate in a rally at the state capital on Monday against the centre's three new farm laws. The police have stepped up security at Azad Maidan, the rally's venue in south Mumbai, and personnel of the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) have also been deployed there. Drones will also be used to keep an eye on the event, a police official said. The All India Kisan Sabha's (AIKS) Maharashtra unit in a statement said around 15,000 farmers had set out for the state capital from Nashik on Saturday in several tempos and other vehicles. NCP chief Sharad Pawar and some other prominent leaders of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in the state will address the rally on Monday, the release said. The state Congress unit, which is an ally of the MVA, has already extended its support to the protest. 9. Several âkhaps' of Haryana are set to join farmers' tractor parade in Delhi on the Republic Day with thousands of these vehicles leaving various caste councils' villages for the national capital on Sunday. About 1,500 tractors from villages under the Kandela khap set out on Sunday for the 'tractor parade' in Delhi, Khap head Tekram Kandela said. âWe have started from Jind. We will be proceeding in a peaceful and orderly manner and follow the route allotted by the authorities for the parade,â Kandela said. The Kandela khap, which had spearheaded a farmers' agitation in Haryana nearly two decades ago, has lent its support to farmers against the new farm laws. Several other âkhaps' too are backing farmers' agitation against the new farm laws. 10. More batches of farmers from Punjab set out for Delhi to participate in the proposed tractor parade on January 26. A batch of 500 tractors-trolleys left Amritsar and several groups of growers from Phagwara, Hoshiarpur and other places of Punjab moved towards the national capital to take part in the tractor parade, farmer leaders said. Kisan Sangharsh Union leader Baldev Singh Verka in Amritsar said, "Today as many as 500 more tractor trolleys left for Delhi to join the tractor parade. "Each tractor-trolley will carry 20 persons along with bedding and eating arrangement for a 14-hour-long journey to Delhi".

 NEW DELHI The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Monday a plea seeking grant of one more chance to appear in the UPSC's civil services examination to those aspirants who could not appear in their previous attempt last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation. The crucial hearing assumes significance in the wake of the Centre's assertion last Friday that it was not in favour of granting one more opportunity to the civil services aspirants who could not appear in their last attempt in 2020. A bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar had taken note of the submissions of Additional Solicitor General S.V. Raju, appearing on behalf of the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) on January 22 and had asked the government to file an affidavit to this effect. â¬ÅWe are not ready to give one more chance. Give me the time to file an affidavit... yesterday night, I received instruction that we are not agreeable, the law officer had told the bench. The bench, which also comprised Justices B R Gavai and Krishna Murai, had asked the law officer to supply the copy of the affidavit to the counsel of civil services aspirant Rachna who had moved the court with the plea for grant of extra chance to crack the test. Earlier, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had told the bench that the government was considering the issue of granting one more opportunity to those civil services aspirants who could not appear in their last attempt to crack the UPSC exam. The top court on September 30, last year, had refused to postpone the UPSC civil services preliminary exam, which was held on October 4, because of the COVID-19 pandemic and floods in several parts of the country. However, it had directed the Central Government and the Union Public Service Commission to consider granting an extra chance to candidates who otherwise have their last attempt in 2020, with corresponding extension of the upper age-limit. The bench was then told that a formal decision can be taken by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) only.

 NEW DELHI: The total number of beneficiaries vaccinated against Covid-19 crossed 16 lakh on Sunday with Karnataka inoculating the highest number of healthcare workers so far at over 1.91 lakh, followed by Odisha (1.52 lakh) and Andhra Pradesh (1.47 lakh). On Sunday, only five states â Haryana, Karnataka, Punjab, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu conducted vaccination sessions. The provisional data compiled by health ministry showed 31,466 beneficiaries were vaccinated in 693 sessions held in these states till 6:30 pm on the ninth day. Only 10 adverse events after immunization were reported on Sunday. âFinal reports would be completed for the day by late tonight,â the health ministry said. So far, 16,13,667 beneficiaries have been inoculated against Covid-19 since the vaccination drive was rolled out on January 16 with two vaccines â Oxford University and AstraZeneca developed Covishield and Bharat Biotechâs Covaxin â both of which are being manufactured locally. The government aims to vaccinate three crore health and frontline workers in the first round which is likely to be completed by March-April. In the next round âpriorityâ population groups including those above 50 years age and those younger but with co-morbidities will be covered. Once the supply of vaccines improves, the government may also start inoculating the priority groups simultaneously.

 NEW DELHI: After a gap of over two-and-a-half months, India and China on Sunday held the ninth round of military talks specifically focusing on ways to move forward on the long-negotiated disengagement process in eastern Ladakh as thousands of their troops remained deployed at friction points under freezing conditions. The Corps Commander-level meeting began at around 10am at the Moldo border point on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and was continuing till after 9pm, sources said. People familiar with the negotiations said India insisted that the onus is on China to carry forward the process of disengagement and de-escalation at the friction points in the region. India has been maintaining that the disengagement process has to start simultaneously at all the friction points and no selective approach was acceptable to it. Close to 100,000 Indian and Chinese troops are deployed in eastern Ladakh as both sides have been holding on to their ground and showing readiness for a long-haul, amid continuing diplomatic and military talks to find an amicable solution. Reflecting India's firm approach in handling the situation, Army chief Gen MM Naravane had said that Indian troops will hold their ground for as long as it takes to achieve the "national goals and objectives" even as he hoped for an amicable resolution of the row through talks. Sunday's talks took place nearly two weeks after India handed back to China a soldier of the People's Liberation Army after apprehending him at the southern bank of Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh. It is learnt that India's gesture has generated a positive atmosphere. The Indian delegation at the talks was led by Lt Gen PGK Menon, the Commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps. In the military talks, India has all along been demanding restoration of status quo ante in all areas of eastern Ladakh prior to April. The face-off had begun on May 5. The eighth and last round of the talks had taken place on November 6 during which both sides broadly discussed disengagement of troops from specific friction points. The seventh round of Corps Commander-level talks had taken place on October 12 where China had pressed for the withdrawal of Indian troops from a number of strategic heights around the southern bank of Pangong lake. However, India insisted that the disengagement process has to start simultaneously at all the friction points. Last month, India and China held another round of diplomatic talks under the framework of Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on India-China border affairs. However, no concrete outcome emerged from the meeting. Following the sixth round of military talks, the two sides had announced a slew of decisions including not to send more troops to the frontline, refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground and avoid taking any actions that may further complicate matters. This round was held with a specific agenda of exploring ways to implement a five-point agreement reached between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi at a meeting in Moscow on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation(SCO) conclave. The pact included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC.

 NEW DELHI: The Ram Mandir being constructed at Ayodhya is a temple of unity of the country and people from different faiths support it, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said here on Sunday. Speaking at an event at the Delhi BJP office to felicitate people who donated substantial sums for the construction of the Ram temple, Javadekar said the 'Ram Janmbhoomi Andolan' was a movement for the country's self respect. "The Ram Mandir coming up at Ram Janmbhoomi is a temple of unity of the country. Ram unifies the country and symbolises the unity of the country," he said. "When Babar came to India he chose to destruct Ram temple in Ayodhya as he understood that the living force of the country rested there," said the Union Information and Broadcasting minister. He further said the disputed structure that came up after alleged destruction of an ancient Ram temple in Ayodhya was not a mosque because no worship happened there. Javadekar said he was in Ayodhya in 1992 and witnessed how a "historical blunder(Aitihasik Bhool)" was corrected. "We were sleeping there a night before. The three domes (of Babri Masjid) were visible. Next day the world saw how a historical blunder was removed," he said. Javadekar said the collection of contributions from people for the Ram temple is like the one under which farmers of six lakh villages provided pieces of iron for Sardar Patel's statue in Gujarat. He said the Supreme Court judgement paving the way for construction of the Ram temple led to a wave of joy across the country. "I am happy that lord Ram is no longer claimed by one religion and has become a symbol of pride for the entire country. Even people of other religions favour construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya," he said. He said construction of the Ram Mandir has begun in Ayodhya and it will be completed in two years. Not only all Indians but crores of people from all over the world will visit Ayodhya to see the grand Ram temple there, added the minister.

 BENGALURU: Indian mathematician Nikhil Srivastava, working at the University of California, Berkeley at present is among the winners of the prestigious 2021 Michael and Sheila Held Prize, announced last week by the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS). Adam W Marcus, EPFL (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne) and Daniel Alan Spielman, Yale University are the other two winners. An Indian national, Nikhil was born in New Delhi in November 1983 and has attended educational institutions across the world â Syria, UK, Saudi Arabia and US â as his father, Niraj Srivastava, was an Indian foreign services officer, who has served as Indian ambassador to Uganda and Denmark. At present, he is an associate professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkely. âMarcus, Spielman, and Srivastava solved longstanding questions on the Kadison-Singer problem and on Ramanujan graphs, and in the process uncovered a deep new connection between linear algebra, geometry of polynomials, and graph theory that has inspired the next generation of theoretical computer scientists,â the NAS said in a statement. The groundbreaking papers on these questions published in 2015 solved problems that mathematicians had been working on for several decades, the NAS said. âIn particular, their solution to the Kadison-Singer problem, first posited in 1959, has been hailed as one of the most important developments in mathematics of the past decade. Their proofs provided new tools to address numerous other problems, which have been embraced by other computer scientists seeking to apply the geometry of polynomials to solve discrete optimization problems,â the NSA added. The Michael and Sheila Held Prize is presented annually honouring outstanding, innovative, creative, and influential research in the areas of combinatorial and discrete optimisation, or related parts of computer science, such as the design and analysis of algorithms and complexity theory. The $1,00,000 prize, established in 2017, is intended to recognize recent work â defined as published within the last eight years. Arabic School To Microsoft ResearchAn apparently joyous Niraj, while pointing out Nikhilâs interest in mathematics, told TOI: âNikhil, as a young mathematician, was the first joint winner of the prestigious 2014 George Polya Prize. He was recognised for finding a solution to a problem that had eluded mathematicians for more than half a century. He had begun work on this even while he was doing his PhD.â Thanks to Niraj, Nikhilâs first school taught in Arabic. âIâve had eight foreign postings in my career, and he moved with us everywhere until Class 12. In fact, he began his schooling in Syria (Damascus), where he attended an Arabic school,â Niraj said. After Syria posting the Srivastavas moved back to Delhi where Nikhil did schooling up to class 2. Then, he went to school in the UK, while Niraj was at Oxford university on a sabbatical in 1989. âAfter that, I was posted in Washington D.C, and Nikhil studied at a school in Virginia. He studied up to grade 4 there before moving to Libya, where he completed class 5, 6 and 7,â Niraj added.

 NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said Indian scientists have done their duty by developing the Covid-19 vaccine and "now we have to fulfil ours" by defeating through the right information every network spreading lies and rumours about the vaccination. Addressing tribal guests, National Cadet Corps (NCC) cadets, National Service Scheme (NSS) volunteers and tableaux artists who would be a part of the upcoming Republic Day parade, Modi said such youth organisations have always played a role in dealing with challenging times. "In COVID times also, the work done by you is laudable. When the government and administration needed it, you came forward as volunteers and provided help," he said at the âAt Home' event. "Whether it was spreading awareness about the Aarogya Setu App or coronavirus infection spread, the work done by you was praiseworthy," Modi said. The prime minister said the youths should now step forward to assist in the COVID-19 vaccination programme by providing the right information to the people. "You need to take it to the next level now. Your reach is in all parts of society. I request you to come forward to help the country with the COVID-19 vaccination programme. You have to provide the right information on vaccines to the poor and general public," Modi said. "Indian scientists have done their duty by developing the coronavirus vaccine and now we have to fulfil ours. We have to defeat every network spreading lies and rumours with the right information," Modi said. He also said that India will achieve self-reliance by the actions of the youth who have to be armed with necessary skills. "India will not become 'aatmanirbhar' (self-reliant) just by somebody saying so, it will become so by the actions of youths like you. You will be able to do this better when you will have the necessary skill set," Modi said. Realizing the importance of this, the ministry of skill development was formed when his government came in 2014 and more than 5.5 crore youths have been given training for different skills till now, Modi said. Under the skill development programme, not just training, but also help is being provided for self-employment and employment, the prime minister said. The aim is that the youths in India get new employment opportunities based on their skill sets, Modi said. This focus on skill development is evident in the new National Education Policy where the application of knowledge is stressed upon, he said, adding that flexibility in choosing subjects is a key aspect of the policy. The policy marks the first serious effort to bring vocation education into the mainstream of education, Modi said. From class six onwards, students will have the option of selecting a course in line with their interests and local needs and business, he said. Later at the middle level also, an integration of academic and vocational subjects is proposed, the prime minister pointed out. Modi told his young guests that India is an embodiment of the collective strength of aspirations of its countrymen. He said India means "many states-one nation, many communities -one emotion, many paths-one goal, many customs-one value, many languages-one expression and many colours-one tricolour". Modi appealed to the young guests from various parts of the country to work towards raising awareness about each other's customs, cuisine, languages and art. The prime minister said that âEk Bharat-Shreshth Bharat' sentiment will give strength to the âlocal for vocal' movement. "When one region will feel pride in the product of the other region and will promote it, only then the local product will have a national and global reach. The success of âvocal for local' and 'Aatamnirbhar Abhiyan' is dependent on our youth," Modi said. The prime minister said the participation of the tribal guests, artists and the NSS and NCC cadets in the Republic Day Parade fills every citizen with energy and their display of the country's rich diversity evokes a feeling of pride. The Republic Day Parade is a tribute to India's great socio-cultural heritage and to the Constitution that gives life to the world's biggest democracy, Modi said. He noted that this year India enters the 75th year of independence, celebrates the 400th Prakash Purab of Guru Teg Bahadur and also marks the 125th birth anniversary celebrations of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. "These events inspire us to rededicate ourselves to the cause of the country," the prime minister said. Union Ministers Rajnath Singh, Arjun Munda, Kiren Rijuju and Renuka Singh Saruta were among those present. "Today, very special people came to 7, Lok Kalyan Marg. Had a wonderful interaction with NCC Cadets, NSS Volunteers, Tableaux Artists and youngsters from tribal communities," the prime minister tweeted after the event.

 NEW DELHI: With Delhi Police giving its final nod for tractor march by farmers on restricted routes inside the city on Republic Day, the umbrella body of the farm unions, Samyukta Kisan Morcha, on Sunday stepped up enrolling volunteers to make their âKisan Gantantra Paradeâ a âcompletely peacefulâ event. The Morcha also issued certain dos and donâts to adhere to all specific points which it promised to the police while seeking permission for the rally. Besides, it released a dedicated helpline number to respond to queries of participants so that no one can face any difficulty while marching inside Delhi.   The union leaders claimed that lakhs of farmers from several states, including Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, will participate in the tractor rally which may, at least, take 24 hours to complete. Each tractor will have not more than five farmers including the driver. âHam Dilli jeetne nahin ja rahe hain. Ham desh ka dil jeetne ja rahe hain. (We are not going to win Delhi. We are going to win the heart of the country),â said Yogendra Yadav of Jai Kisan Andolan while appealing farmers to make the event completely peaceful by showing utmost discipline.   Emerging from the meeting with Delhi Police personnel, he announced that the unions have got âformal permissionâ for the tractor rally on specified routes on January 26. âItâs now our responsibility to hold the rally in a manner that there should not be any disturbance,â said Yadav while appealing farmers, who gathered at different borders around Delhi, to enter the city on Republic Day only with their tractors, leaving trolleys outside the border. âOnly trolleys which are being prepared for tableaux will go inside the Capital on dedicated routes,â said Yadav. The umbrella body in a statement on guidelines for farmers and volunteers appealed to participants to keep with them ration of 24 hours â an indication that the parade may take that much of time in completing the circle on designated routes.   It appealed to the farmers not to raise any negative or inflammatory slogans or carry any such banners with them. The Morcha also made it clear that the tractor would not carry flags of any political parties during the march. Only national flags and flags of farmersâ organizations will be used. âPolice control room should be contacted at 112 for providing information in case of any untoward incident,â it said, adding that action will be taken against participants if they wonât adhere to the designated routes and the guidelines.

 (BHUBANESWAR/KONARK): Confined to her home for most part of the pandemic since March last year, when 70-year-old Savitri Rout finally got the opportunity to go for a weekend getaway with her children and grandchildren in January, the family chose an âeco retreatâ along the Chandrabhaga beach in Konark. Sitting with her 20-year-old grand-daughter in the dining area and watching the high tide hit the shore, she said she was happy to be out again. Safety remains a prime concern for those willing to step out but travelling very far is still not on the minds of many. Those keen on a holiday are clearly looking for spaces that can be the âone-stop shopâ for all their vacation needs. Also, while protocols exist, implementation and compliance is what dominates conversations around travel among tourists. Speaking to TOI, Odishaâs minister for tourism and culture Jyoti Prakash Panigrahi said, âThere is no doubt that the tourism sector is one of the worst hit by the pandemic, but it is also a fact that the revival of this sector is a key priority area for us. We also want tourism in Odisha to grow beyond religious tourism so that people experience our coastal belt that is spread over 482 km.â An experiment to test the waters is underway through the eco retreat model in Konark and four other sites in Odisha. Offering tourists the option to stay in temporary luxury tent cottages, the âglampingâ retreats came up in December and despite the pandemic, they have logged over 60% occupancy. According to principal secretary, tourism, Vishal Kumar Dev, the occupancy status was a positive sign. The state set up the first glamping eco retreat in Konark last year which recorded 81% occupancy, prompting the government to expand to four more locations this year at Hirakud, Bhitarkanika, Daringbadi and Satkosia. Saurabh Tripathi, who hails from Delhi and works in Bhubaneswar, said the eco retreats had provided people like him an opportunity to experience a vacation at locations like Konark and Satkosia rather than travel to far off places like Goa. Data collected by the state government showed that eco tour nature camps â a community-led project of the forest department â had recorded 80% occupancy with 21,000 night stay tourists at the various camps over the last two months. Odisha is also trying to reach tourists keen on road travel instead of air and rail during the pandemic. The government has rolled out the âOdisha by Roadâ campaign and has identified routes with options for people from neighbouring states to make pit stops and take up packages for stay, sightseeing, route maps and information on safety protocols. A large number of tourists to Odisha come from states like West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh. (The writer was in Odisha at the invitation of the state government).

 NEW DELHI: Pitching for another term for a BJP-led government in Assam to "safeguard" the interests of the state, Union home minister Amit Shah took potshots at Congress-AIUDF saying the alliance would open "all gates" to infiltrators if voted to power. In his first political rally in the poll-bound state, Shah also took a swipe at the Congress for calling the BJP "communal", and questioned the grand old party's alliance with the Muslim League in Kerala and the Badruddin Ajmal-led AIUDF in Assam, two regional parties that draw their support mostly from Muslims. He also took a dig at the Assam Jatiya Parishad, a party floated by former AASU leader Lurinjyoti Gogoi which is tipped to ally with Akhil Gogoi-led Raijor Dal, without naming them, saying they are in the poll arena to help the Congress by trying to cut into votes of the BJP. The Congress hit back saying that the BJP's agenda is to destroy Assamese identity through the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and Hindutva politics. Senior Congress leader Pradyut Bordoloi said that the blatant violation of the Assam Accord by imposing CAA speaks volumes about the saffron party's attitude towards the Assamese language and culture. "The BJP's claim of safeguarding Assamese language and culture by giving awards to renowned personalities is an eyewash to hide its agenda of destroying Assamese identity through CAA and Hindutva politics," the Nagaon MP told reporters. He alleged that the BJP was attempting to rename schools and colleges in the state after RSS leaders such as Deen Dayal Upadhaya and not Assamese freedom fighters. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's claim that the BJP has ensured peace and stability in Assam by curbing insurgency is untrue as it is well-known that the Congress government is credited with the surrender and rehabilitation of several ULFA leaders and bringing peace to the state, Bordoloi said. "It is evident from Assam's growth chart from 2006- 2016 that the Congress had effectively curbed insurgency in the state with stability and development being reflected in the GDP growth from 1.75 per cent in 2001 to 6.68 per cent in 2013-14," he said. Bordoloi alleged that 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' in reality is only aimed at promoting business for people from Gujarat and other parts of the country and there is no scope for Assamese entrepreneurs in the state. Lashing out at the Congress, the home minister said the party had adopted the British Empire's policy of "divide and rule" by pitting different groups of people against one another, leading to bloodshed and loss of lives of thousands of youths. "Tell me loudly," he asked the crowd, "Can the Congress and Ajmal keep Assam free from infiltrators? If they come to power, they will open all gates to welcome them because they are their vote bank." Only the Modi government at the Centre and a government in the state which has its guidance and blessings can stop infiltration, he said. Listing out development works carried out in Assam, he said over 20,000-km road length has been laid out in the state and six bridges constructed over Brahmputra. New hospitals and educational institution were built as well, he said. Bank accounts have been opened for over 7.20 lakh tea garden workers, he said, adding the Centre gave Rs 1.55 lakh crore to the state under the 14th finance commission against only Rs 79,000 crore it had received when the Congress was in power in New Delhi. Shah also referred to the annulment of provisions of Article 370, a move he said fully integrated Kashmir with India, and the beginning of the Ram temple construction in Ayodhya to laud the Modi government's work. The BJP had come to power in the state for the first time in 2016, ending the 15-year long uninterrupted reign of the Congress. (With agency inputs)

 NEW DELHI: The delivery of the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) to the Indian Air Force under a Rs 48,000-crore deal will begin from March 2024 and around 16 aircraft will be rolled out annually till the completion of the total supply of 83 jets, Chairman and Managing Director of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited R Madhavan said on Sunday. In an interview to PTI, Madhavan also said that a number of countries have shown keen interest in procurement of the Tejas aircraft and that the first export order is likely to come by in the next couple of years. Madhavan said that Tejas Mark 1A jet has superior performance levels compared to China's JF-17 combat aircraft as it has better engine, radar system and electronic warfare suit, besides an edge in the overall technology. "The biggest difference, of course, is the air-to-air refuelling which is non-existent in the competitor's plane," he said. The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 13 approved the Rs 48,000-crore deal to procure 73 Tejas Mk-1A variants and 10 LCA Tejas Mk-1 trainer aircraft from the HAL to boost the Indian Air Force's combat prowess. Giving a break-up of the cost components, Madhavan said the basic price of the aircraft will be around Rs 25,000 crore while Rs 11,000 crore will be used for ground support equipment and other required infrastructure at the bases and around Rs 7,000 for basic customs duty and output GST. The HAL chairman said the cost for each fighter version of the aircraft will be Rs 309 crore and Rs 280 crore for the trainer. "The price is tight but we are fine with it," Madhavan said The total cost of Rs 48,000 crore includes design and development cost of Rs 2,500 crore to be given to Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) and around Rs 2,250 crore set aside for variations in foreign currency exchange rate. The Tejas Mk-1A will be equipped with an active electronically scanned array radar, beyond visual range missile, electronic warfare suite and air-to-air refuelling system. A formal contract for the deal is expected to be signed between the HAL and the IAF on February 5 at the Aero India exhibition in the presence of President Ram Nath Kovind. "Three years is the strategic timeline for developing infrastructure as well as delivery of the aircraft. We will meet the timeline. The first aircraft is expected to be delivered by March 2024. "Initially we will supply around four aircraft and increase the number to 16 annually from 2025," Madhavan said. Asked whether a possible export order will push the delivery deadline for supplies to the IAF, Madhavan said the HAL will strictly follow the timeline for domestic order and can always set up additional production lines when necessary. "We are planning for more than 16 aircraft annually so that in case of any other order coming in, we can take it up. We are already increasing production rates. "The second phase of the LCA plant has already come up, though we need it after 2024-25," he said. The IAF has already inducted a batch of Tejas aircraft as part of its initial order of 40 jets. Madhavan said the Tejas programme will boost the overall aerospace sector in India, noting that it currently involves 563 domestic enterprises. "And it will go up to 600 to 650. This is important for the ecosystem." He said Tejas will be able to operate as efficiently as any other aircraft in all regions including mountainous Ladakh. The government has been majorly focusing on boosting domestic defence production and set a target of Rs 1.75 lakh crore ($25 billion) turnover in defence manufacturing by 2025. According to estimates, the Indian armed forces are projected to spend around $130 billion in capital procurement in the next five years. In May last year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman rolled out several reform measures for the defence sector including making separate budgetary outlay to procure Indian-made military hardware, increasing FDI limit from 49 percent to 74 percent under the automatic route and generating a year-wise negative list of weapons which won't be imported.

 TIRUPUR: Continuing to target Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his second day of campaign in Tamil Nadu, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday alleged Chinese troops have occupied Indian territory and the man with "56 inch-chest" cannot even utter the name of the neighbouring country. Addressing meetings here and in neighbouring Erode as part of three-day campaign tour of Tamil Nadu for the assembly elections to be held in the next few months, he also repeated his charge that Modi governed the country for just five or six business people. The Central government was not for the farmers, labourers or the Micro Small or Medium Enterprises, that are the nation's future and abound in this region of the state, Gandhi, on a campaign tour of western districts, said. "For the first time, the Indian people can see that Chinese troops have occupied Indian territory. As we speak today, thousands of Chinese troops are occupying our territory and the man with a 56-inch chest cannot even say the word China. That is the reality of our country," he said. Taking forward his 'Tamil language and culture' pitch to connect with the people and attack the BJP, the Congress MP said he wanted to be the soldier of the Tamil people in Delhi and reiterated that he would not allow the saffron party to disregard Tamil culture. Gandhi, who also addressed people from his vehicle at some places during a roadshow, accused the BJP of trying to impose one culture one and language on people and relegate Tamil to a 'second class place'. "I understand, accept and respect the Tamil spirit and culture. I am not going to allow the Prime Minister and the BJP to disrespect the Tamil people no matter what," he said in his speeches in English, translated into Tamil. India was home to many diverse cultures, religions and languages... "it is the nation's strength. It is our duty to protect ever single language, culture and religion in this country," he said. In a veiled attack on Modi's monthly radio programme, the top Congress leader said his Tamil Nadu visit was not to tell people his 'Mann Ki Baat,' or advise them on what they should do but to listen to them, understand their problems and help resolve them. He said the rest of the country could learn a lot from Tamil Nadu history and language. Waving at people from his car at key intersections, the Congress leader also got off the vehicle and shook hands with people waiting on the roadside at several junctions. He was accorded a warm welcome by party workers who played traditional music. While many presented him shawls, some showered rose petals on him. An elderly woman applied 'Vibuthi' (sacred ash) on his forehead as a mark of blessings and several took 'selfies' with him. He garlanded a statue of late chief minister and Congress stalwart K Kamaraj.

 NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police on Sunday said that over 300 Twitter handles have been generated in Pakistan to create disturbance during the farmers' tractor rally in the national capital on Republic Day. "Through intelligence and various other agencies, we have continuously been getting inputs regarding threat to create disturbance during the tractor rally. 308 Twitter handles have been generated from Pakistan between January 13 and 18 to create confusion," said Dependra Pathak, Special CP (Intelligence), Delhi Police. Pathak said that in view of the threat, adequate security arrangements will be provided during the tractor rally after the Republic Day parade concludes. "It will be a challenging task for us but the rally will be conducted amid tight security after the Republic Day parade is over," Pathak said at a press conference. Detailing the plan, Pathak said that the rally will enter Delhi from Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur borders and return to its originating points. "From Singhu, it will pass through Kanjhawala, Bawana, Auchandi border, KMP Expressway and then return to Singhu. From Tikri border, it will go to Nagloi and pass through Najafgarh and Western Peripheral Expressway. From Ghazipur border, the rally will go to 56-foot road and return to its originating point passing through Kundli-Ghaziabad-Palwal Expressway," he said. On Saturday, the farmer unions were given permission to take out a tractor march on January 26 as a mark of protest against the Centre's three agriculture laws. Enacted in September last year, the three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of minimum support price and do away with the 'mandi' (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

 NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said Indian scientists have done their duty by developing the Covid-19 vaccine and "now we have to fulfil ours" by defeating through the right information every network spreading lies and rumours. Addressing NCC cadets, NSS volunteers and artists who would be participating in the Republic Day parade, Modi said such organisations have always played their role in dealing with challenging times. "In Covid times also, the work done by you is laudable. When the government and administration needed it, you came forward as volunteers and provided help," he said. "Whether it was spreading awareness about the Aarogya Setu App or coronavirus infection spread, the work done by you was praiseworthy," Modi said. The prime minister said the youths should now step forward to assist in the Covid-19 vaccination programme by providing the right information to the people. "You need to take it to the next level now. Your reach is in all parts of society. I request you to come forward to help the country with the Covid-19 vaccination programme. You have to provide the right information on vaccines to the poor and general public," Modi said. "Indian scientists have done their duty by developing the coronavirus vaccine and now we have to fulfill ours. We have to defeat through right information every network spreading lies and rumours," Modi said. He also said that India will not become self-reliant just by somebody saying so, but this will be achieved by actions of the youth for which they have to be armed with necessary skills. "India will not become 'aatmanirbhar' (self-reliant) just by somebody saying so, it will become so by actions of youths like you. You will be able to do this better when you will have the necessary skill set," Modi said. Realizing the importance of this, the ministry of skill development was formed when his government came in 2014 and more than 5.5 crore youths have been given training for different skills till now, Modi said. Under this skill development programme, not just training is being given, help is being provided for getting employment, the prime minister said. The aim is that the youths in India get new employment opportunities based on their skill sets, Modi said. He again stressed on 'Vocal for Local', saying it will gain more strength from the 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat' sentiment.

 NEW DELHI: Delhi police have formally given permission for the protesting farmers' tractor rally--Kisan tractor rally-- to be held on January 26, said Yogendra Yadav, chief of Swaraj India on Sunday. While talking to the media, Yadav said that this comes after a short meeting with officers of Delhi Police. "Today there was a short meeting with officers of Delhi Police. We have got formal permission from Police for the tractor rally. As I said earlier, 'Kisan Gantantra Parade' will be held on January 26 in a peaceful manner," Yadav told the media. He also appealed to the farmers to bring their tractors inside Delhi and asked them not to bring trolleys. Delhi Police Commissioner SN Shrivastava in a statement said that all officers and men, as well as CAPF and other force deployed for Republic Day Parade security, should remain in a ready position to move at short notice for law and order arrangement in connection with Kisan tractor rally. Farmers from all across the country are marching towards Delhi in order to take part in the scheduled rally. Tractors from Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan have reached on Tikri border as the farmers sit in for protest for nearly two months. The eleventh round of talks between farmers and the government was held on Friday. The talks of farmer unions and the government have seemingly broken down after the former insisted on their demand for the repeal of three new farm laws and the latter asked them to reconsider its offer to put these laws on hold for about 18 months. Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.

 Need to induct leaders from other parties to expand base: Bengal BJP chief

 KOLKATA: Amid a spate of defections from the ruling TMC to the saffron camp in Bengal ahead of the assembly polls, state BJP president Dilip Ghosh on Sunday allayed apprehensions that the turncoats would be given more importance than the old timers, bringing relief to some of the party's angst-ridden leaders. Switching political allegiance doesn't always guarantee leadership positions, he asserted. Ghosh, however, insisted that the party, in order to expand its base and come to power in Bengal, needs to induct people from other political outfits. In an interview to PTI, he also clarified that everybody has to abide by the rules and regulations of the party, be it the old-timers or the newcomers. "The BJP is a growing force in West Bengal. Our organisation is getting strengthened with each passing day; people from other parties including the TMC are joining us. If we don't take people from other outfits, how will we grow," he asked. "No matter who joins the camp, I would like to add that everyone has to abide by the rules and regulations of the party. No one is above the party," he said, when asked about reports of infighting in certain pockets of the state over induction of leaders from the TMC. According to saffron camp sources, several party cadres and the RSS â the BJPs ideological parent â are not very happy with the induction of certain leaders in the party. "There could be complaints against some leaders, but one has to understand that not everyone who joins us will be given a position of leadership. In a democracy, numbers play an important role. We have to get the numbers (to come to power)," he said. Many senior TMC leaders, including political heavyweight Suvendu Adhikari, 14 other MLAs and a sitting MP, have switched over to the saffron camp in the last two years. Three Left MLAs and four Congress legislators have also joined the saffron camp. Talking about Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjees allegation that the BJP has turned into a "washing machine" that cleanses corrupt turncoats after inducting them, Ghosh said taking someone into the party fold does not mean justifying his wrong deeds. "We are not certifying or justifying anyone or anything. If someone is proven guilty, he or she will have to face the consequences. It's the TMC that believes in the culture of corruption. "In our society, a section of people are into politics, and wherever this section goes, that party grows from strength to strength. If there are some politicians who are willing to join us, we will welcome them. Law, on the other hand, will take its own course," he stated. Ghosh, however, maintained that the party has put in place a mechanism to look into the profile of cadres and workers before inducting them. "We are not here to judge anyone. But that doesn't mean we will induct each and every one. There is a screening process and everybody has to go through it. We can never deliver good governance if we don't come to power. For that, we need to expand our base," he said. Ghosh assured the old-timers that they have nothing to worry about, as each of them will be accommodated according to their abilities. Referring to the "outsider versus insider" debate in West Bengal, Ghosh said the TMC has raked up the issue as it has nothing else to talk about. The TMC, after a decade in power in the state, has nothing to talk about, it seems. Ours is a national party, and our leaders will come here to assist us. But those who are fighting elections or are working at the grassroots level are residents of this state. So the allegations are all baseless, he underlined. Exuding confidence that the BJP will come to power with more than two-thirds majority, Ghosh said the party would draft a road map for the development of the state. Speaking on the issue of projecting a chief ministerial candidate before the assembly polls, Ghosh said it is for the leadership to decide. "In states where we were in opposition, we chose our CM candidate after winning the elections. Our party believes in collective leadership. Naming a chief ministerial candidate is not important," he pointed out. Asked if he would take up the challenge if the party anoints him as its CM face, Ghosh said, he is a loyal soldier of the BJP, and has always taken up all responsibilities bestowed upon him. "When I was asked to become the state president of the party, I accepted it. I worked hard... When I was asked to contest for an MLA or an MP post, I agreed. Whatever responsibility the party assigns to me, I will perform my duty diligently," he added.

 Congress slams govt over rise in fuel prices, demands rollback of central excise duty hike

 NEW DELHI: The Congress on Sunday slammed the Centre over fuel prices touching an "all-time high" and demanded that the excise duty hike affected by the Modi government during its tenure be immediately rolled back to give relief to the masses. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked the Centre over the rise in fuel prices, saying people are suffering due to inflation while the Modi government is busy in tax collection. The party's attack on the government came a day after petrol and diesel prices in the country touched new all-time highs after rates were increased for the fourth time in the week. Congress spokesperson Ajay Maken said in Delhi on Sunday the petrol prices have reached an all time high of Rs 85.70 per litre and diesel has reached Rs 75.88 a litre. "What is more shocking is that during the Congress' regime when we left power in May 2014, the international crude oil was USD 108 per barrel, but petrol and diesel prices were at Rs 71.51 and Rs 57.28 per litre respectively, which have increased to Rs 85.70 and Rs 75.88 in Delhi today despite the crude oil prices coming down to half of that time," he said at a media briefing. The Modi government has earned Rs. 20,00,000 crore in the last six and a half years by increasing the excise duty on petrol and diesel alone, Maken alleged. "The most important question now is where has this more than Rs 20 lakh crore gone," he said. "Has it gone in the pockets of Mr (Narendra) Modi's crony capitalist friends. This is what the Congress wants to know from the government," Maken asked. Earlier, in a tweet in Hindi, Gandhi said, "Modi ji has brought about tremendous growth in GDP -- gas, diesel and petrol -- prices". "People are suffering due to inflation, while the Modi government is busy in tax collection," he alleged. The increase in prices took the petrol price in Delhi on Saturday to Rs 85.70 per litre and in Mumbai to Rs 92.28. Diesel rate climbed to Rs 75.88 a litre in the national capital and to Rs 82.66 per litre in Mumbai, the price data showed. In his remarks, Maken asked, "Our jawans' dearness allowance is being cut, our MSMEs are under pressure from banks to repay loans, under pressure from taxation authorities, there is huge unemployment across the country, farmers are committing suicide, so where has this amount gone?" In May 2014 when the BJP assumed power, the excise duty on petrol was Rs 9.20 per litre and on diesel was Rs 3.46 per litre, he said. In the last over six years, the BJP government has increased the excise duty on petrol by an additional Rs 23.78 per litre and on diesel by an additional Rs 28.37 per litre, he said. "If we decrease the excise duty hike affected by the Modi government on petrol and diesel i.e. Rs 23.78 and Rs 28.37, prices will come down to Rs 61.92 (petrol) and Rs 47.51 (diesel)," he said. "So the central government must immediately withdraw the central excise duty hike that it has charged in the last over six years and the petrol prices should come down to Rs 61.92 and diesel to Rs 47.51," he said, hitting out at the government over the fuel prices touching an "all-time high". Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan earlier this week blamed Saudi oil output cut for the surge in oil prices but remained non-committal on tax cuts. Top oil explorer Saudi Arabia has pledged additional voluntary output cuts of 1 million barrels per day in February and March, which has led to fuel prices climbing up the most since the pandemic broke out. Maken also slammed the government over LPG cylinder prices, saying under the UPA government 12 cylinders were given on subsidy which has now been withdrawn. An LPG cylinder in the open market coats about Rs 700 whereas without subsidy during the UPA's governance it was Rs 414.

 MUMBAI: Thousands of farmers have left from various parts of Maharashtra to participate in a rally at the Azad Maidan in Mumbai on Monday against the Centre's three new farm laws. Police have stepped up security at the venue in south Mumbai and personnel of the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) have also been deployed there. Drones will also be used to keep an eye on the event, a police official said. The All India Kisan Sabha's (AIKS) Maharashtra unit in a statement said around 15,000 farmers set out for the state capital from Nashik on Saturday in several tempos and other vehicles. On Monday, NCP chief Sharad Pawar and some other prominent leaders of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in the state will address the rally, the release said. The state Congress unit, which is an ally of the MVA, has already extended its support to the protest. Farmers from various places gathered in Nashik and left from there on Saturday. Many peasants also joined them on the way, the AIKS said. They halted at Ghatandevi near Igatpuri hill town for overnight stay. On Sunday morning, a number of peasants marched down the Kasara Ghat to head for Mumbai, while many left in vehicles. "The rally is being held to support and expand the two-month-long farmers' struggle in Delhi for a repeal of the three farm laws and for a central law to guarantee a remunerative Minimum Support Price (MSP) and procurement all over the country," the statement said. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a pro-farmer body, has given a nationwide call for a struggle from January 23 to 26, including rallies to Raj Bhavans (governor houses) in states. Accordingly, over 100 organisations came together and formed the Samyukta Shetkari Kamgar Morcha (SSKM), Maharashtra, in a meeting held in Mumbai on January 12. The SSKM has called for a joint sit-in at the Azad Maidan here from January 24 to 26. On January 25, there will be a public meeting at 11 am, the release said. Besides NCP chief Pawar, state Congress president and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, and Shiv Sena leader and state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray will also address the rally, it said. Later, the protesters will march to the Raj Bhavan and submit a memorandum to Governor B S Koshyari. The main demands of the protesters include repeal of the three "anti-farmer" laws, and a central law guaranteeing remunerative MSP and procurement, the release said. The protesters have also decided to hoist the national flag at the Azad Maidan on the occasion of the Republic day on January 26, and take a pledge to make the struggle of peasants and workers successful, it added. Meanwhile, security has been beefed up at the venue ahead of the rally, a police official said. Apart from personnel of the Mumbai Police, nine platoons of the SRPF are being deployed at the Azad Maidan, he said, adding that drones will also be used. Additional police force, including 100 officers and 500 constables, will also be deployed at the venue, he added. Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the 'mandi' (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several border points of Delhi, demanding a repeal of the three farm laws. Multiple rounds of talks between the government and farmer unions have failed to break the impasse so far, while the Supreme Court has appointed a panel for resolution of the issue.

 NALBARI: Asserting that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government has made Assam free from bullets and agitations, Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday urged people to give five more years to make the state free from flood too.  While addressing 'Vijay Sankalp Samaroh' rally in poll-bound Assam's Nalbari, Shah also attacked the Congress party and its ally All India United Democratic Front-AIUDF led by Badruddin Ajmal.  "A flood of development came here. Hospitals, new roads, colleges are being constructed. Industries are being set-up here. In the coming days, Only BJP can solve the biggest problem of Assam -- floods. We have made Assam free from bullets and agitations. Give five years more to BJP and we will make Assam free from flood too," he said.  Attacking the Congress party, Shah said Congress cannot stop infiltrators in Assam as they are its vote bank.  "Can Congress and Badruddin Ajmal stop infiltrators in Assam? They will allow infiltrators since it is their vote bank. Only the Narendra Modi-led BJP government can free Assam from infiltrators," he said.  "Many times, the Congress has accused the BJP of being communal, while the Congress is with the Muslim League in Kerala and is in alliance with Badruddin Ajmal in Assam. In which direction will the Congress take Assam? I want to ask the people who were in power for years, what you did for Assam's culture? What did you do for the development of Assam?" he added.  Listing out some of the developments in Assam by the BJP government, Shah said that in the 13th Finance Commission, the state was given only Rs 79,000 crore.  "In the 14th Finance Commission, the BJP government gave Rs 1.55 lakh crore to the state. We opened bank accounts of about 7.20 lakh people in the tea garden area. BJP has done the work of giving Rs 5,000 to about 60.20 lakh people in 26 districts of Assam," he added.  Shah is in Assam as part of a two-day visit to the region. Earlier in the day, he addressed a public rally to mark the first anniversary of signing the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) Accord at Kokrajhar in Assam.  The term of the 126-member Assam Assembly is ending on 31 May 2021.

 NALBARI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday alleged that if the Congress-AIUDF combine come to power in Assam, they will open "all gates" to welcome infiltrators. Addressing a public rally here, Shah said the Congress rule in the state gave only bloodshed, in which thousands of youths lost their lives. "Can Congress and Badruddin Ajmal keep Assam free from infiltration? If they come to power, they will open all gates to welcome them, because it is their vote bank," he said. PM Modi, BJP committed to fulfil promises made when Bodo Accord was inked: ShahOnly the BJP government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi can protect the state from infiltration from the neighbouring country, Shah said in his first election rally in poll-bound Assam. The Congress has formed Grand Alliance with AIUDF, CPI, CPM, CPI(ML) and Anchalik Gana Morcha (AGM) to fight the upcoming assembly election, likely to be held in March-April. Attacking the Congress, Shah said, "Congress continued the British policy of divide and rule. They created a divide between Adivasis and non-Adivasis, Assamese people and hill peoples, Bodos and non-Bodos. "In 20 years there was only bloodshed and 10,000 Assamese youths were killed by bullets fired by the Congress." Appealing to the people to vote for the BJP, Shah said if the party comes to power again, Assam will be "bullet-free, agitation-free and flood-free". Shah also slammed the Congress for its constant criticism that the BJP is a communal front and said, "Congress alleges us to be communal, but it has allied with Muslim League in Kerala and AIUDF in Assam. "One thing is sure, Assam is not safe in the hands of Congress and AIUDF".

 NEW DELHI: Amidst protest from opposition and a section of farmer's organisations, the Monsoon Session of the Lok Sabha passed three agriculture sector bills which will replace the existing ordinances once they are passed by the Rajya Sabha also. On Thursday, SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Union council of ministers protesting against the bills which she said are anti-farmer and will destroy the agriculture sector in Punjab. Here is all you need to know about the three bills: 1. Bill on agri marketFarmer's Produce Trade and Commerce(Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020Provisions* To create an ecosystem where farmers and traders enjoy the freedom to sell and purchase farm produce outide registered 'mandis' under states' APMCs. * To promote barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade of farmers' produce * To reduce marketing/transportation costs and help farmers in getting better prices * To provide a facilitative framework for electronic trading Opposition* States will lose revenue as they won't be able to collect 'mandi fees' if farmers sell their produce outside registered APMC markets. * What happens to 'commission agents' in states if entire farm trade moves out of mandis? * It may eventually end the MSP-based procurement system. * Electronic trading like in e-NAM uses physical 'mandi' structure. What will happen to e-NAM if 'mandis' are destroyed in absence of trading? New farm bill 2020: Who is protesting &amp; why2. Bill on contract farmingThe Farmer (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020Provisions* Farmers can enter into a contract with agribusiness firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters or large retailers for sale of future farming produce at a pre-agreed price * Marginal and small farmers, with land less than five hectares, to gain via aggregation and contract (Marginal and small farmers account for 86% of total farmers in India) * To transfer the risk of market unpredictability from farmers to sponsors * To enable farmers to access modern tech and get better inputs * To reduce cost of marketing and boost farmer's income. * Farmers can engage in direct marketing by eliminating intermediaries for full price realisation * Effective dispute resolution mechanism with redressal timelines. Opposition* Farmers in contract farming arrangements will be the weaker players in terms of their ability to negotiate what they need * The sponsors may not like to deal with a multitude of small and marginal farmers * Being big private companies, exporters, wholesalers and processors, the sponsors will have an edge in disputes. 3. Bill relating to commoditiesThe Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020Provisions* To remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities. It will do away with the imposition of stockholding limits on such items except under "extraordinary circumstances" like war * This provision will attract private sector/FDI into farm sector as it will remove fears of private investors of excessive regulatory interference in business operations. * To bring investment for farm infrastructure like cold storages, and modernising food supply chain. * To help both farmers and consumers by bringing in price stability. * To create competitive market environment and cut wastage of farm produce. Opposition* Price limits for "extraordinary circumstances" are so high that they are likely to be never triggered. * Big companies will have the freedom to stock commodities- it means they will dictate terms to farmers which may lead to less prices for the cultivators. * Recent decision on export ban on onion creates doubt on its implementation.

 NEW DELHI: The novel coronavirus is now spreading much more rapidly outside China than within the country, leading the world into uncharted territory, but the outbreak can still be contained, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The virus has so far claimed over 3,000 lives and there are over 90,000 confirmed cases.  What is coronavirus?Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. What are zoonotic?Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. What are the signs of infections?Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How to prevent infection from spreading?Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Stay home when you are sick. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Who should wear a facemask?It is not necessary for people who are well to wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others, Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said. What is the treatment for novel coronavirus?There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19. People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. People who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider immediately. Here is a list of dos and don'ts issued by the government to stall the spread of the virus in the country âDo's Cover your nose and mouth with disposable tissue or handkerchief Frequently wash your hands with soap and water Avoid crowded places Person suffering from Influenza like illness must be confined at home Stay more than one arm's length distance from persons sick with flu Take adequate sleep and rest Drink plenty of water/liquids and eat nutritious food Person suspected with Influenza like illness must consult doctor Don'ts Touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands while coughing or sneezing Hugging, kissing and shaking hands while greeting Spitting in public places Taking medicines without consulting doctor Disposal of used napkin or tissue paper in open areas Touching surfaces usually used by public (railing, door, gates, etc)

 NEW DELHI: Several parts of the country, including Odisha, Kerala, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Delhi, are witnessing a solar eclipse on Thursday morning, which is said to the last one of the decade. The solar eclipse, which occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, began at around 8:17 am and will continue till 10:57 am today. It is also being referred to as "ring of fire" and "Surya Grahan" in Hindi. The beginning of the eclipse can be first seen from the Arabian sea coast of Oman at around 7:59 hours IST and the annular eclipse will become first visible in west of Baharain at 09:06 hours IST, Duari added. Here is all you want to know about solar eclipse.  What is a solar eclipse? A solar eclipse occurs when a portion of the Earth is engulfed in a shadow cast by the Moon which fully or partially blocks sunlight. This occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned. Such alignment coincides with a new moon indicating the Moon is closest to the ecliptic plane. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured. If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit, a little closer to the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth. A solar eclipse can only occur when the Moon is close enough to the ecliptic plane during a new moon. What is a âRing of Fireâ during solar eclipse?We do not get to see a âRing of Fireâ during all solar eclipses and those solar eclipses where a âRing of Fireâ is visible is called an annular solar eclipse. During such an eclipse, the centre of the Sun is covered by the Moon in such a way that the outer edge of the Sun is left visible and it looks like a ring. When viewed from a long distance it looks like a ring of fire around the Moon called the 'annulus'. However, when an annular solar eclipse takes place, the âRing of Fireâ is not visible from all places on earth. As a result of which the annular solar eclipse may look like a partial solar eclipse. When does an annular solar eclipse happen? We do not get to see a 'ring of fire' during all solar eclipse. For an annular solar eclipse to take place, three things need to happen â there should be a New Moon, the Moon should be at or very near a lunar node so that the Sun, Moon and the Earth all are in a straight line and the Moon should be near the apogee (the farthest point of the Moon from Earth) so that the outer edge of the Sun is visible. The 'Ring of Fire' is visible only when all these three parameters are met. When will solar eclipse start on Wednesday According to the India Meteorological Departmentâs Kolkata-based Positional Astronomy Centre, the solar eclipse will begin at 8am on Thursday. It will slowly increase in intensity before peaking two hours later. It will end at 1.35pm. Places where solar eclipse can be seen In Delhi, the partial eclipse will begin at 8.17am while the greatest eclipse will start at 9.30. The partial eclipse will end at 10.56am and the total duration of the eclipse will be 2 hours and 39 minutes. The solar eclipse will be at its maximum intensity at 10.47am and will remain so for a little under four minutes. The eclipse will be visible in some parts of India, Sri Lanka, UAE, Sumatra, Australia, Philippines and Singapore. People living in Ooty, Mangalore, Coimbatore, Shivagange, Tiruchirappalli and Kasaragod will be able to see the âring of fireâ. However, residents of New Delhi, Pune, Jaipur, Lucknow, Kanpur, Nagpur, Indore, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Surat, Bhopal, Visakhapatnam, Ludhiana and Agra will only witness a partial solar eclipse. âFrom India, annular phase will be visible in the morning after sunrise from some places within a narrow corridor of southern part of the country (parts of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu) and it will be seen as partial solar eclipse from the rest part of the country. The narrow corridor of annular phase of the eclipse will pass through the southern part of the country through certain places like Kannur, Coimbatore, Kozhikode, Madurai, Mangalore, Ooty, Tiruchirappalli, etc,â a bulletin of the Positional Astronomy Centre stated.  Precautions while watching the solar eclipse âThe eclipse should not be viewed with the naked eye. It will cause permanent damage of the eyes even when the moon covers most portion of the sun. Safe technique to observe the solar eclipse is either by using proper filter like aluminised Mylar, black polymer and welding glass of shade number 14 or by making projection of the sunâs image on a white board by a telescope,â the bulletin stated.  Dos and donts on solar eclipseExposing your eyes to the sun without proper eye protection during a solar eclipse can cause âeclipse blindnessâ or retinal burns, also known as solar retinopathy, say opthalmologists. "Radiation from the sun is so powerful that regular sunglasses or lens in cameras will not be able to filter," says senior opthalmologist Dr Mohan Rajan. "Looking at the sun for more than 90 seconds exceeds threshold of retinal damage," he said. The harmful ultra violet rays from the sun can destroy cells in the retina that transmit what you see to the brain, sometimes causing permanent damage. Many times people it can occur without pain. "Symptoms can take a few hours to a few days after viewing the solar eclipse to realize the damage that has occurred," he said. Many experience loss of central vision (solar retinopathy) , distorted vision or altered color vision. Do not watch the eclipse on * Smartphone * Camera viewfinder, telescope or binoculars * Unsafe filters or glasses. Dos Use specifically designed for viewing a solar eclipse. Follow directions to use carefully

 NEW DELHI: Amid the furore over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the Union Cabinet on Tuesday   approved funds   to the tune of over Rs 8,500 crore for updating the National Population Register (NPR), officials have said. The NPR exercise is to commence from April next year. The NPR is a list of "usual residents" of the country. Updating of this data was done during 2015 by conducting door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed. Meanwhile, the Left parties announced a seven-day nationwide protest from January 1 to 7 and a general strike on January 8 against the CAA, the NPR and the NRC. In a joint statement, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Communist Party of India, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)-Liberation, the All India Forward Bloc and the Revolutionary Socialist Party said the protest programme was announced in solidarity with the trade unions, which have also called a general strike on January 8. Now it has been decided to update the National Population Register along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April to September 2020 in all the states/union territories, except Assam.  What is NPR?The National Population Register (NPR) is a register of usual residents of the country being prepared at the local (village/sub-town), sub-district, district, state and national level under provisions of the Citizenship Act 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. It is mandatory for every usual resident of India to register in the NPR. Under the NPR, a usual resident is defined as a person who has resided in a local area for the past six months or more or a person who intends to reside in that area for the next six months or more. What is its purpose? NPR's purpose is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars. Aadhaar, mobile number, PAN, driving license, voter ID details and Indian passport numbers are among the details that will be collected from all usual residents of India. Sharing of Aadhaar is voluntary in view of the Supreme Court ruling in this regard. What are the demographic details required?Name of person Relationship to head of household, Fatherâs name, Motherâs name, Spouseâs name (if married), Sex, Date of Birth, Marital status, Place of birth, Nationality (as declared), Present address of usual residence, Duration of stay at present address, Permanent residential address, Occupation/Activity, Educational qualification. What is the current status? Data for NPR was collected in 2010 during collection of data for Census of India 2011. It was updated in 2015 through a door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed. NPR data will now be updated along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April-September 2020 in all states except Assam. A gazette notification to this effect has already been published by the central government. Which states have blocked NPR? The West Bengal government this month stayed all activities related to the preparation and updation of NPR. The decision came amid violent protests in parts of the state over CAA and chief minister Mamata Banerjee reiterating that the law and the proposed pan-India NRC will not be implemented in the state. Mamata Banerjee said, "All activities regarding the preparation and updation of the National Population Register are stayed in West Bengal. No activity regarding NRP may be taken up without clearance from the government of West Bengal." Kerala and Rajasthan have followed suit, saying they will not work on compiling the NPR as mandated by the Centre to record 'basic information' on citizens. "After considering the concerns raised in the wake of the 2019 amendment in the Citizenship Act, the state government has decided not to cooperate with the process to update the NPR to facilitate the preparation of the NRC," the office of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a statement last week. Why is Assam excludedAs of now, the NPR exercise is not being undertaken in Assam. Assam recently had the NRC exercise undertaken to identify and detain illegal immigrants. The purpose of a pan-India NRC it to detect illegal immigrants and detain them, irrespective of faith, however there are concerns it could arbitrarily exclude genuine Indian citizens. How can NPR data be accessed NPR data will not be put in the public domain but will remain a secure database accessible to the relevant user through password protected protocols. The government says it will use the data to enhance the targeting of beneficiary-oriented schemes and will have implications on improving internal security.

 NEW DELHI: Amid the protests across the country over the amended Citizenship Act, the government has said that there is no link between the new law and NRC. Home minister Amit Shah had earlier set a 2024 deadline for implementing the NRC across the country. Meanwhile, the Centre on Thursday clarified that the exercise to prepare an all-India National Register for Citizens â National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC), as per the Citizenship Rules, 2003 â was yet to be notified and as and when it is done, rules and instructions would be framed in such a way that no Indian citizen is inconvenienced. Here is all you need to know about the NRC:  What is NRC (National Register of Citizens)?NRC means the National Register of Citizens. NRC is a list of Assam's residents â prepared to identify bonafide residents and deport illegal migrants in the northeastern state bordering Bangladesh. So far, this has been a state-specific exercise to keep its ethnic uniqueness unaltered.But ever since its implementation, there has been a growing demand for its nationwide implementation. Many top BJP leaders, including home minister Amit Shah have proposed that the NRC in Assam be implemented across India. It effectively suggests to bring a legislation that will enable the government to identify infiltrators who have been living in India illegally, detain them and finally deport them where they came from. Who stands to lose?The proposed Bill, which till now remains just a proposal, if implemented will target illegal immigrants in India. But Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhist, Jains and Parsis coming from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh won't be affected, if they claim they have arrived India after fleeing religious persecution. It essentially means, if a nationwide NRC is implemented as proposed, any illegal immigrant from other than Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, will be affected. And as for those three nations, people coming from there who belong to the Muslim community will also be affected as they are not included in the Citizenship Amendment Act. Who will be excluded?As proposed, if a nationwide NRC comes in place, the affected will be detained and taken to large detention centres, as it is happening in Assam. After that, the ministry of external affairs will get in touch with the concerned nations. If the details of the detained are matched and accepted by the concerned nations, deportations will follow. Assam is setting up detention centres exclusively for those declared foreigners after exhausting all legal routes. Repatriation of such people looks difficult as India and Bangladesh do not have any treaty in this regard at this point of time. The politics of NRCAmit Shah has been raising the pitch for a nationwide NRC for some time now. As late as this October, Shah raised the matter in West Bengal, not far from Assam. In Haryana, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar too made the promise of bringing the NRC in the state during his election campaigning. Even Mohan Bhagwat, the RSS supremo has been pitching for the same, though behind closed doors. Possibility of NRC in the rest of IndiaThe Centre has been pushing for NRCs in every state. Nagaland has already started an exercise to create a similar database of citizens known as the Register of Indigenous Inhabitants. The Centre has also announced plans for a National Population Register (NPR) which will contain demographic and bio-metric details of citizens. A pilot NPR project was launched when the UPA government was in power but was not completed.  What is NRC (National Register of Citizens)?NRC means the National Register of Citizens.

  What is Citizenship (Amendment) Bill?The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill seeks to provide Indian nationality to six communities â Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis, Jains and Buddhists fleeing persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.The bill amends the Citizenship Act, 1955 to make illegal migrants in the select categories eligible for citizenship. What does the government say:Home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday rejected the Opposition's charge that the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was anti-Muslim, saying it does not take away the citizenship of any Indian Muslim and only seeks to given the same to persecuted minorities of three neighbouring countries. Replying to a debate on the bill in Rajya Sabha, he said the need to bring this Bill would not have arisen had Partition not taken place on the basis of religion. The Bill does not snatch citizenship of Muslims and their is no need for them to have any fear, he said. What does the opposition say:The legislation has been attacked by opposition parties, minority outfits and others for leaving out Muslims and also on the grounds that it is at odds with the Constitution, which does not differentiate between citizens on the basis of their faith. Who are the parties opposing/supporting the Bill?Congress, Trinamool, DMK, Samajwadi Party, RJD and Left, and even parties like Shiv Sena and BJD have expressed reservations. BJP's Assam ally AGP seemed to have warmed up to the idea of CAB after the government assured changes to the Bill. The government has the support of regional allies â Akali Dal and JD(U). AIADMK also voted in favour of the Bill in Rajya Sabha. Why are some northeast states opposing the Bill?The CAB has sparked resentment in the northeast as it is feared that granting citizenship to foreign refugees will undermine the ethnic communities living in these regions.There are indications that the government is working out a compromise. Formulations like provision of citizenship not leading to residency status in the smaller north-east states were discussed. Why has BJP's Assam-ally AGP taken a U-turn on CAB?In January last year, BJP's ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) had pulled out of NDA after Lok Sabha passed the earlier version of the Bill, which BJP had introduced in Parliament in 2016. When the Bill lapsed in the Lok Sabha, AGP returned to the alliance.Recently, the AGP has indicated a U-turn on the proposed Bill. âWe have to move forward with the reality â neither can we expel lakhs of illegal migrants nor will Bangladesh ever take them back. We had our government twice in the past but we could not even identify the illegal migrants. Unfortunately, the Assam Accord has only gathered dust for over 34 years," AGP member and Assam minister Atul Bora said.

 NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Monday passed Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, after division that allows the Central government to notify the term of office for the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and Information Commissioners (ICs) with the Opposition slamming the measure as diluting the provisions of the legislation. The Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, 2019 was passed with 218 members voting in its favour and 79 against it after a reply by Minister of state for personnel, public grievances and pensions, Jitendra Singh. The 2005 Act was enacted during the first Congress-led government UPA government. According to the activists, the efficacy of the RTI Act, allowing any Indian to seek information from any authority on the payment of Rs 10, hinges closely on the independence of the CIC and its equivalents in the states â state information commissions that adjudicate the matter in case information is not furnished to applicants within the parameters of the law. Here is explain: Whatâs changed in Parliament: While Lok Sabha was never a problem, the NDAâs weakling status in the Rajya Sabha prevented it from pushing several contentious bills â with its total strength in the Upper House less than that of the Opposition. However, that may not be a problem any longer as the NDA, along with some âfriendlyâ parties such as the TRS, YSRCP, BJD and others has a strength of 127 in the 245 member House of Elders, more than the halfway mark of 123. That should help it push through the bill after it passes in the Lok Sabha. Whatâs in the bill: The amended bill does away with the fixed tenure of five years for the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and the Information Commissioners (IC) â instead, they will serve for a tenure determined by the Central government. Moreover, the salary of the CIC and the ICs which are currently benchmarked with the salary of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and the Election Commissioners respectively, which in turn are benchmarked with the salary of a Supreme Court judge, amount to Rs 2.50 lakh, along with a monthly allowance of Rs 34,000 per month â plus the usual perks like rent free furnished accommodation and 200 litres of fuel every month. The amended bill gives the government to fix the salary, which could be lower â given that the Information Commission is a statutory body unlike the EC which is a constitutional body. However, the current incumbentsâ salaries will not be affected by the amendment. How will that affect RTI? Currently, the CIC and the IC are chosen by a three member panel of the PM, the Leader of Opposition or leader of the largest opposition party in Lok Sabha and a Cabinet minister nominated by the PM. Similarly, the State Chief Information Commissioners (SCIC) and State Information Commissioners (SIC) are chosen by a three member panel comprising the state CM, the stateâs leader of opposition or leader of the largest opposition party in the state assembly and a state cabinet minister nominated the chief minister. The amended bill arrogates the power of appointment and the term as well as the salary of SCIC and SIC to the Central government â which nullifies the independence of the state legislatures. Even the CIC and the ICs will serve at the pleasure of the government â raising the possibility that they would be more interested in ensuring the longevity of their tenures rather than serving the citizensâ interests. Termination of terms? Current rules stipulate that no CIC, IC, SCIC or SIC serve more than one term, for a maximum period of 5 years or till the age of 65, whichever is earlier. For ICs and SICs, if one of them is nominated to the post of CIC or SCIC, his/her total tenure as both IC and CIC or SIC and SCIC can not exceed 5 years. While the new bill gives the government the power to fix tenures, it's not clear whether an incumbent seen as pliable or âfriendlyâ to the Centre may get to serve more than one term. Appointments & dismissals: If the tenure of the CIC, IC, SCIC and SIC are to be fixed by the Centre, it may follow that their removal from office may also be dependent on the Centre â whereas in the original bill, the CIC and IC may be removed only by the President â and the state Governor in case of SCIC and SIC â after an enquiry by the Supreme Court finds reason for their dismissal from office.
