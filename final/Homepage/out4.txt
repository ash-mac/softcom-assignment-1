 HYDERABAD: In a first such move, bar councils of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala on Sunday came together and unanimously demanded a Supreme Court bench in south India. The councils said, they made the demand keeping in mind the people who end up relinquishing the idea of accessing the highest court of justice due to lack of reach and their inability to afford the costs of reaching a faraway Supreme Court. The chiefs of these bar councils deliberated on this demand at a webinar organised by the Telangana state bar council. They elected Telangana bar council chairman A Narasimha Reddy as convenor of the committee formed to achieve this goal. Though the demand for a SC bench has been there for a while, it is for the first time that top legal experts from the region have jointly vowed to fight for it. Reddy said it was incomprehensible as to why the SC is not setting up its appellate benches in four parts of the country. âThe Supreme Court at Delhi can exclusively concentrate on constitutional issues while its appellate benches in the four corners would decide the appeals emanating from the high courts,â he said. The bar councils unanimously resolved to seek an appointment and meet President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu, PM Narendra Modi, law minister, the Chief Justice of India, and all the judges of the Supreme Court in the coming days. The delegation will brief them about the problems faced by the people of south India, whose cases are pending at the high courts because reaching the Supreme Court is considered âimpracticalâ in terms of affordability, the delegates said. The meeting also decried the exorbitant fees charged by advocates of the Supreme Court. This is making the top court affordable only by the rich and the corporates, they said.

 NALBARI/KOKRAJHAR: Home minister Amit Shah on Sunday launched BJPâs Assam campaign, promising that the party would âexposeâ Congressâ secular credentials and highlighted the latterâs alliance with Badruddin Ajmal-led AIUDF. Addressing a rally in BJPâs stronghold of Nalbari in lower Assam, Shah sought another five years after the party formed a government for the first time in 2016 to continue the pace of development and keep the state safe from "violence, corruption, agitations and also floodsâ, a major bane for the state. Shah said while BJP has managed to contain infiltrators, Congress and AIUDF would open the floodgates for them. The minister cited Congressâs alliances with the Muslim League in Kerala and Ajmal in Assam and said the opposition party should stop shedding crocodile tears in the guise of âsecularismâ. BJP has planned five big rallies before assembly poll dates are announced. âCan Congress and Ajmal keep Assam free from infiltrators? If they come to power, they will open all gates to welcome them because they are their vote bank,â Shah said and took swipe at Congress for dubbing BJP âcommunalâ. Shah also addressed the issue of extremism, saying PM Modi was on a mission to end militancy in the entire northeast with the signing of the Bodo accord one year ago. âThe PM started ending the unrest not only in Assam but the entire northeast and it started with the Bodo peace agreement, followed by the Bru-Reang agreement. Today the era of violence is coming to an end and the era of peace is beginning,â he said. He added that the PM had scrapped Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution from J&K and in the recent panchayat elections, police did not have to shoot a single bullet and peaceful polling took place. He said an assistance of Rs 4 lakh had been started for all surrendered militants and work of honouring the Bodo language was also being done and the long pending demand was fulfilled by according it the status of the stateâs co-language.

 KOLKATA: Taking exception to PM Modiâs âsilenceâ on Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee being greeted with chants of âJai Shri Ramâ at Saturdayâs official Netaji birth anniversary event in Kolkata, Trinamool Congress on Sunday termed the conduct of a section of the audience âmisogynisticâ and an affront to what Subhas Chandra Bose stood for. âPM Modi did not utter a single word to condemn the behaviour of a section of the audience...This shows BJP has no respect for Netaji and has no idea of what he stood for,â minister Bratya Basu said. He accused BJP of trying to promote âa certain concept of Lord Ramâ in Bengal. âBengalâs concept of Ram, which we have grown up with, entails respect for women. Those who used Sri Ramâs name in their slogans at Victoria (Memorial) neither respect Ram nor women.â Trinamool MP Abhishek Banerjee said, âMamata Banerjee is a CM elected by 2.5 crore people in Bengal. By not allowing her to speak, she was insulted.â Mamata had been invited to speak at the event in Victoria Memorial ahead of the PM, but she returned to her seat the moment some in the crowd uttered âJai Shri Ramâ. Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said, âThis wasnât a political programme. This was a government programme. Their understanding of what should be said where, is slightly less.â Many among the bevy of celebrities who attended the event, including some who have been critical of TMC, said they loved everything about the event other than the row over âJai Shri Ramâ. Responding to the outrage, BJP demanded to know if Mamataâs refusal to speak at the event amid chants of âJai Shri Ramâ was a political stance or not. Netajiâs grandnephew Chandra Kumar Bose, who had contested the South Kolkata Lok Sabha seat on a BJP ticket, criticised the CM over her reaction to the chant.

 NEW DELHI: Remote voting, or allowing a voter to cast her franchise from any polling station in the country and not just the polling station or constituency where she is registered, is among the key future initiatives that the Election Commission is working on, chief election commissioner Sunil Arora said on Sunday and added that mock trials of the project would begin soon. Sharing an âimportant dimension of the vision of Election Commission of India for future electoral processesâ, Arora in a public broadcast on the eve of National Votersâ Day, observed on January 25 each year to mark the foundation day of the EC, said, âWe have already started a research project on remote voting, using cutting edge technology, with IIT-Madras and other institutions and it has made good progress. Mock trials of this project will begin soon.â In each election, thousands of voters have to forego their right to vote on account of a geographical barrier. By virtue of occupation, education, medical treatment or other reasons, there have been instances of current residence of such electors being different from the place of registration in electoral rolls. Remote voting marks a departure from the conventional polling station, which is currently tied to a geographic location. The remote voting project aspires to enable voters residing in remote locations, away from their designated polling stations, to cast their ballot in a secured fashion. The EC is also looking to extend postal ballot facility to overseas voters, who currently need to be physically present at their respective polling stations in the country to be able to vote. Arora said the ECâs proposal in this regard was being considered by the law ministry. Underlining the high voter turnout in Bihar polls last year despite the Covid-19 pandemic, Arora called upon voters of four states and one Union Territory due for assembly polls in April to âcome out to vote in large numbers without any fear, inducement or influence of any typeâ. âWe also hope that you will make effective use of the C-Vigil app launched by the commission as a pilot project in 2018 and extended to the entire country in Lok Sabha elections 2019. It has over a period of time emerged as the most powerful and effective tool for citizen empowerment. We also assure you that we will make all-out arrangements to ensure that the entire voting process and premises are completely sanitised as well as safe for the exercise of your franchise,â he said. Talking of new EC initiatives, Arora said the e-EPIC card would be launched on Monday âfor all our young, newly-enrolled voters to make the process of electoral registration easier and digitalâ. He added that âHello Votersâ, the ECâs web radio, will help to further strengthen the commissionâs engagement with voters. âIn the days to come, this will emerge as the nerve-centre of voter awareness, information sharing, stories from our unsung heroes and election warriors,â the CEC said.

 Not sex assault if no skin-to-skin contact: HC

 MUMBAI: When there is âno direct physical contact â skin to skin with sexual intent, without penetration,â it would not amount to âsexual assaultâ under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, Bombay high court held while acquitting a 39-year-old man who had been sentenced to three yearsâ imprisonment under section 8 of the Act by a trial court for pressing the breasts of a minor. Justice Pushpa Ganediwala of Nagpur bench of the HC said âstricter proof and serious allegations are requiredââ given the stringent punishment of three to five yearsâ imprisonment that âsexual assaultâ under the Pocso Act entails. âEvidently, it is not the case of the prosecution that the appellant removed her top and pressed her breast,â said Justice Ganediwala adding, âThe act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years, in the absence of any specific detail as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hand inside the top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of âsexual assaultââ. But it would attract punishment for molestation under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), said the HC, and convicted him for the âminor offenceâ. He was sentenced to one year in jail. The HC said the issue before it was whether âpressing of breastâ and âattempt to remove salwarâ would fall within the definition of âsexual assaultâ as defined under Section 7 and punishable under Section 8 of the Pocso Act. While public prosecutor MJ Khan argued the offence fell within the definition of âsexual assaultâ, the HC held it was ânot possible to acceptââ the prosecutorâs submission. The court said the âbasic principle of criminal jurisprudence is that punishment shall be proportional to seriousness of crimeâ. The trial court in Nagpur had last February sentenced the man under section 8 of the Pocso Act and under section 354 IPC (assault or criminal force with intent to outrage a womanâs modesty). The man had appealed his conviction. The girl had testified that she was lured on a false pretext by the accused to his house. She said he had tried to remove her salwar and had pressed her breast. She tried to shout, but he covered her mouth and left the room after bolting the door from outside. Her mother went to his house while looking for her. She had seen the accused leave, and on reaching the first floor found the door bolted from outside and her daughter crying inside. She then went to the police station along with her daughter to lodge an FIR, noted the HC. The man was on bail. The HC issued a non-bailable warrant against him and said all his other sentences shall run concurrently and he would be entitled for a set-off of term undergone in custody.

 DHARAPURAM: Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said the Chinese gathered guts to intrude into the Indian territory because of a weakening economy which was the result of flawed policies of âweakâ PM Modi. âThe Chinese understand that the man running this country is weak. They understand that the PM has destroyed the economy of India. That is why they are inside our territory,â Rahul said on Sunday at Dharapuram town in Tirupur district of Tamil Nadu. âAs we speak today, thousands of Chinese troops are occupying our territory and the man with a 56-inch chest cannot even say the word China. That is the reality of our country,â he said. He spoke on similar lines earlier in the day while addressing weavers in Erode. On day two of his three-day election campaign in Tamil Nadu, Rahul focused on attacking Modi rather than the AIADMK dispensation, which he sought to replace with a government that âcannot be controlled by BJPâ. Rahul said BJPâs economic policies had âdealt a severe blow to farmers, weavers, labourers and MSMEsâ, who are foundation of the country. âI can tell you without doubt if the Indian economy was strong, China would have never got the guts to step into India,â Rahul said.

 NEW DELHI: Innocuous though it may seem, polls for the central election committee of Congress will open the entire decision-making process in the organisation outside the official group, a reason why it has emerged as the latest bone of contention in the party. The Congress constitution is so designed that election to the CEC will force the leadership to set up the parliamentary board, which is a key demand â besides elections to the post of party president and the Congress Working Committee â of the dissident group known as the G-23. This demand was the reason for the spat in the CWC meeting held on Friday, where the group loyal to the Gandhis led by Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot and Ambika Soni and the G-23 led by Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma and Mukul Wasnik clashed. Though the CEC is merely a deliberative body which decides party candidates for assembly and parliamentary polls, a nod to its election would mean the party would have to constitute the parliamentary board â the top body on parliamentary issues which was discontinued by then party chief and PM P V Narasimha Rao in 1992. Article 25B of the Congress constitution says, âA CEC shall be set up consisting of members of the parliamentary board and nine other members elected by the AICC for the purpose of....â On the other hand, the parliamentary board, as per the Congress constitution (Article 25A), is set up by the CWC and consists of nine members, including the leader of Congress in Parliament. The Congress chief is its chairperson. While Congress has agreed to hold elections for the party president and the CWC, it has not yet spelt out whether it will set up the parliamentary board. âThe push for election to the CEC is designed by dissidents to ensure an across-the-board say in decision-making. Whoever has thought of it has read the party constitution and is being clever. It is not the central election committee but the parliamentary board that they are eyeing,â a Congress insider said.

 Recently we have seen many divas like Lara Dutta and Sushmita Sen create waves in the action space on the digital platform, and joining them is yet another beauty queen, Ruhi Singh! By featuring in Ekta Kapoor's action-thriller franchise 'Bang Baang â The Sound of Crimes' opposite Faisal Shaikh, Ruhi is all set to showcase yet another versatile role in the web series under the banner of ALT Balaji. The former beauty queen who has been nominated for the Times most desirable list 2021, in a candid chat, opens up about her character â Meera, love for action-hero roles, her upcoming projects, and more. We know you are trained in martial arts, and so how was the experience shooting for an action thriller?I have been training in martial arts, karate, Shaolin Kung Fu, and a beginner in onscreen combat, and so it was an excellent experience to showcase all of these skills onscreen. I thoroughly enjoyed playing Meera in the series. Growing up, my favorite action hero was Xena: Warrior Princess, and Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie has always inspired me as an actor, so I always wanted to do an action role like her. I love action, and I've done my own stunts in 'Bang Baang.' We have seen a severe side of you in the trailer, but yet you managed to bring in elegance with your performance; how do you always manage to do that?Yes, I play the role of a serious cop. It's different from all the roles I have ever played, and Meera is pretty elegant. I think it's extremely important to understand a character altogether to portray it perfectly. Rather than exaggerating a performance, I think it's important to feel the emotion, so I think there is a certain elegance and subtlety to Meera. As an actor, it's my dream to play diverse characters and bring their stories to life. I hope these characters and their tales enrich you as much as playing them enriches me. You have earlier performed with Faisal in a music video, and your on-screen chemistry was a superhit, so can we expect the same from Raghu and Meera?Yes, 'Maangi Duaein' with Faisal was quite a big hit, and in fact, we just finished another one together. Our onscreen chemistry is definitely loved by many out there, but I also feel that it's essential to be comfortable with your co-actor and, as an actor, a part of your job to try to give your all, to make sure your chemistry works. I always make sure that I make my co-stars comfortable, which then reflect in our performance. We have seen you keep busy even amid the pandemic; share your experience shooting amid restriction? Yes, I am the person who can't sit idle, and I always have to do something or the other, which is why during the pandemic I initiated a talk show called 'Yuhi with Ruhi', which was really popular as I spoke to my friends from the (Bollywood) industry. I also worked on my fitness and improved my skills -- I tried to learn different dialects and learned a few dance forms from Youtube. I am also studying law, and I make sure my syllabus is completed on time, so I'm generally a very busy person. It's obviously an extraordinary time; everything is new, but then it's imperative to be careful, so I followed all Covid protocols and tried to keep myself secure during shoots. Soon after the trailer was received, your fans showered their love and appreciation; how do you feel with less than 24 hours to its release? What message would you like to share with your fans?I am who I am because of the audience. I was a total outsider to the industry and had been standing firm on my terms from being Miss India to an actress to an internet sensation and being loved by millions on social media. All of this was possible because of my fans and my hard work, and I am super grateful to them for being my rock! I am so thrilled for 'Bang Baang' to release because, firstly, Meera is a character that is very close to my heart, and we have worked really hard on this project. And yes, my fans have been showering us with love and appreciation, and everybody is so excited. It was quite evident after our trailer and teaser started trending in a real short span from its release, so I can't even imagine what will happen when the show delivers tomorrow. The series is anticipated to be an absolute hit; we are thrilled to see Ruhi back in action; what about you?
